Stock Class is as close to a stock Bronco as these drivers get, with the same transmission and engine used to power them to victory.

Flex Buy
Flex Buy is a Ford Credit-exclusive payment structure focused on providing lower payments for the first three years when compared with a standard retail contract.
Financing That Fits Your Budget
Flex Buy is like traditional retail financing where the interest rate doesn’t change and you own the vehicle. What makes Flex Buy different is the unequal payment structure. It starts with a lower payment for the first 36 months, then the payment increases at month 37 so that the balance is paid in full by the end of the contract term. Flex Buy is offered with 66- or 75-month terms.
  The Benefits
Lower payments for the first three years
Build equity with every payment and trade when you're ready
No surprises with a fixed interest rate
Freedom to customize your vehicle
Multiple term and payment discount options to fit your needs
  Flex Buy is unavailable in Maine, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Washington, D.C.

The privacy practices of Ford dealers, dealer distributors, dealer advertising associations, or other dealer associations.

Dealers
When you purchase or lease a Ford or Lincoln vehicle from an authorized dealer, some information you provide to the dealer is disclosed to Ford. Ford’s privacy practices (as described in our privacy notices) apply to personal information the dealer discloses to us, whether in connection with the purchase/lease transaction, vehicle service you may receive from the dealer, or joint marketing activities.
Please be aware, however, that dealers are separate legal entities from Ford and have their own privacy practices. You should contact your dealer directly if you have questions about their privacy practices. Although we encourage dealers to fully satisfy their legal obligations (including those relating to privacy), Ford is not responsible for dealers’ compliance with law.

United States Only
This Notice applies only to personal information collected about individuals in the United States. If you are located in another country, please review the Ford privacy notice that applies to your country.

  CATEGORIES AND SOURCES OF PERSONAL INFORMATION WE COLLECT
The personal information we collect depends on how you interact with us, the Products you use, and the choices you make. We collect personal information about you in different ways and from different sources, including through the Products we provide. Details about our privacy practices relating to Ford and Lincoln vehicles appear in the 
Connected Vehicle Privacy
 section below.

Information You Provide to Us
You provide information to us in various ways, including when you create or modify an account with us, use our Products, make a purchase from us, ask us for information about our Products, sign up for an event, enter a contest or sweepstakes, contact the Customer Relationship Center, or otherwise communicate with us. For example, we collect the following:
Contact Information: Depending on the nature of your interaction with us, we collect personal or business information such as name, email address, postal address, and phone number. We may also ask you to provide email addresses of others, for example if you use a “tell-a-friend” tool.
Demographics: When you interact with us or our Products, you may also provide additional information such as your age range, nationality, and gender.
Payment Data: If you make a purchase, we collect credit card numbers and other payment or billing information.
Preferences: You may indicate preferences such as your preferred communication method, language, time zone, and dealer. When you use the vehicle shopping tools on our website, you indicate through your browsing and searches the kinds of vehicles, features, and options you may be interested in.
Audio/Visual: In some cases, you can upload a photo for a profile image when creating an account, or you may provide your photo at an event or as part of a contest or sweepstakes.
Identifiers: Depending on the nature of your interaction with us, you may provide us with unique identifiers associated with you. For example, when you leave a comment on one of our social media sites, you provide us with your social media ID.
Security: When you create or modify your Ford account, you provide us with an email/username and password, along with other information used to authenticate your account such as answers to security questions, etc. You can use these credentials to sign into other Ford experiences (if supported) including experiences offered by our affiliates, including Ford Credit, so you only need to remember one username and password when accessing our online and mobile Products.
Content of Communications: When you communicate with us, such as via emails, customer service requests, survey responses, website chats or social media posts, likes, or messages, we collect the content of your communication.
Vehicle Service History: We collect vehicle service history from you when you provide it to us on our sites.
When you are asked to provide personal information, you may decline (such as not entering a credit card to use wallet services in the FordPass mobile app). But if you choose not to provide information that is necessary for certain Products, those Products may not function correctly or be available for use.
Where Ford makes chat features available, we utilize vendors, such as LivePerson. Our vendors that support chat features only use chat communications to support and improve the Ford chat experience.

Information From Your Vehicle
Ford and Lincoln vehicles have systems that record data about how the vehicle is performing, how it is driven, where it is located, and the environment where it is operated. This data may be associated with a vehicle's unique identification number (“VIN”) or other identifiers, and VIN or the other identifiers may be linked to you.
If your vehicle is equipped with Connected Services or has factory-installed connectivity technology capable of electronically transmitting vehicle-originated data to Ford, we may collect the following categories of information from your vehicle:
Vehicle Data
Driving Data
Vehicle Location (which may be collected through location-based features and functions in the vehicle or in our mobile apps and which may be derived from other information such as your mobile device’s location)
Audio/Visual
Media Analytics
Vehicle Analytics
Which categories of information are collected from your vehicle typically depends on how the vehicle is equipped for connectivity; in other words, what connectivity technologies, software version, data sharing settings, and Connected Services are present and what selections have been made for the data sharing settings. See the 
Connected Vehicle Privacy
 section below for details and data category definitions.
In limited situations, we may collect Vehicle Location, regardless of location settings. We do this to protect and defend our rights or property (including repossessing a vehicle in the event of a delinquency) or to comply with applicable law, to respond to valid legal process (including from law enforcement or other government agencies), or, in the event of exigent circumstances, to help prevent the loss of life or serious injury or help protect the personal safety of Ford personnel, users of our vehicles, websites, or apps, our visitors, or the public. For additional details about these situations, see the “
Our Disclosures of Personal Information
” section below.

Information From Your Devices
When you use our websites, mobile apps, online services, and other Products, we automatically collect some information from the devices you’re using (such as mobile phone, tablet, smartwatch, or computer). For example:
Device Details and Network Information: Some devices reveal, and our servers log, information such as type of device, hardware model, MAC Address, operating system, version, settings, configuration, and network-related information (for example, IP address, mobile network provider, etc.). We may also collect device motion information if you enable that functionality in our mobile apps. As described more in the 
Cookies
 section below, our websites and online Products store and retrieve device identifiers (such as browser and other unique online identifiers) using cookies, pixel tags, and other digital technologies set on your device.
Digital Activity: As described more in the 
Cookies
 section below, when you browse our website or use our other online Products, we collect information about your online activity and interaction with our Products, such as access times, webpages or content viewed, mouse movements, scrolling, features used, how the webpage or online feature performed, the results of vehicles saved, built, searched for, or viewed during previous visits, other websites visited, etc.
Device and Mobile Location: Depending on your device and app settings, we also collect location data from your devices. If your mobile device is connected to your vehicle via Bluetooth or tether, vehicle location may be derived from mobile device location.
You may use app or device controls to prevent certain types of automatic data collection. But if you choose not to provide or allow information that is necessary for certain Products or features, those Products or features may not function correctly or be available for use.

Information We Generate About You
We generate information from the data we collect. For example:
Digital Activity: When you build or search for vehicles on our website, we generate results that fit your criteria and allow you to save results so that they are available to you in future visits. When you browse our website or use our other online Products, we may infer your zip code, city, state, and/or country location based on your IP address.
Inferred Preferences: We infer new information from other data we collect, including using automated means to generate information about your likely preferences or other characteristics. For example, we may use information about your vehicle and past purchases to determine your likely readiness to make a new purchase, which we may use for marketing, advertising, or other purposes. We may also infer information from your online activity and interaction with our Products, such as webpages visited, vehicles viewed, app features used, etc.
Identifiers: When you interact with us, we may generate unique identifiers associated with you or your devices such as Ford account ID, customer ID, rewards program number, or browser or other online identifiers. These unique identifiers help us identify you or associate you with information about you. For example, in our exhibits at auto shows or other events, we may generate a bar code for each visitor that you can swipe as you interact with the exhibit. It may also allow you to access and spread photos and videos if you use available technology to take your picture and/or video at the event.
Payment Data: We may generate information when you pay for products and services, e.g., transaction history.
Information From Other Sources
We obtain information from others when you direct them to disclose information to us.
We also obtain information from the following sources:
Affiliates: We receive information from other companies within the Ford Motor Company family of companies and affiliates. Our “family of companies” is the group of companies related to us by common control or ownership. Information is disclosed within this “family” as a normal part of business operations, offering products and services to our customers, and allowing our customers to use their Ford account across multiple Ford experiences (if supported).
Dealers and Other Repairers: We receive information in connection with vehicle sales and service. For example, when you purchase a vehicle from a Ford or Lincoln dealer, the dealer provides Contact Information to Ford, including your name and address, as well as VIN and purchase information such as purchase date. When you service or repair your vehicle with a Ford or Lincoln dealer, we receive Contact Information and Vehicle Service History information (and certain other vehicle repair information), which includes history of repairs and may include information such as visit details, service details, repair history, applicable recall repairs, repair order details and payment, and warranty and extended service plan information. We may receive vehicle diagnostic information from dealers or other repairers when your vehicle is serviced or repaired using diagnostic scan tools connected to your vehicle.
Vendors and Suppliers: We may receive Contact Information or other personal information from our vendors or agents working on our behalf for the purposes described in this Notice.
Business Partners: We receive personal information from other companies we work with to offer services to our customers, or to reach potential customers with our marketing messages. Examples include:
                    - Advertising and Analytics Companies: Please see the 
Cookies
 section of this Notice for a description of how we receive information from advertising and analytics providers.
                    - Joint Marketing Partners: We may receive personal information from partners with which we offer co-branded services or engage in joint marketing activities.
  Law enforcement agencies, courts, regulatory agencies, and others: We may receive personal information from government agencies or courts for legal compliance purposes, to protect your personal safety or the safety of others, to protect Ford’s or others’ rights or property, or to investigate fraud. We may also receive personal information from others; for example, in connection with litigation settlements, we may acquire information about you from third parties for the purpose of meeting our tax reporting obligations.
Consumer Data Analytics Firms: We receive Contact Information, Demographics, and other data from third parties for purposes such as keeping information current, supporting our marketing campaigns, and personalizing Products to our customers.
Parties to Corporate Transactions: We may receive personal information as part of a corporate transaction or proceeding such as a merger, financing, acquisition, bankruptcy, dissolution, or at transfer, divestiture, or sale of all or a portion of business or assets.
Publicly Available Sources: We may obtain Demographics and other data from publicly available sources, such as open government databases or other data in the public domain, as well as information that is publicly available online on social media, networking, and other sites.

  COOKIES AND SIMILAR TECHNOLOGIES
Our websites, mobile apps, and other online Products use cookies, pixels, tags, trackers, and similar digital technologies to operate and to help collect data. Cookies are small text files placed on your device to store data that can be recalled by a web server in the same domain that placed the cookie. The text in a cookie often consists of a string of numbers and letters that uniquely identifies your device, but it can contain other information as well.
Cookies on our websites are used to store your preferences and settings, help authenticate your Ford account and enable you to sign in, provide interest-based advertising, combat fraud, analyze how our Products perform, personalize your experience and the content you see on our website (such as by displaying vehicles you have previously viewed or searched for or by conveniently auto-filling data fields in online forms), and fulfill other legitimate purposes.
Our websites may also contain electronic images known as web beacons (also called single-pixel gifs) that we use to help deliver cookies on our websites, count users who have visited those websites, and gather usage and performance data. We also include web beacons in our promotional email messages or newsletters to determine whether you open and act on them, and in our ads appearing on other sites to measure the performance of those ads.
Our websites often include web beacons, cookies, pixels, tags, trackers, and similar digital technologies from third-party vendors. In some cases, that is because we have hired the third party to provide services on our behalf, such as site analytics or advertising. In other cases, it is because our web pages contain third-party content (such as embedded videos, maps, plug-ins, or ads) that contain digital technologies used to track operability and performance of the content, as well as your interaction with the content to determine its effectiveness. When your browser connects to a third party’s web server to retrieve content and/or web beacons, that third party is able to set or read its own cookies on your device and may collect information about your online activities over time and across different websites or online services that also contain that third party’s content or web beacons.
For example, our online Products use third-party tools (such as Mouseflow, Dynatrace, Amplitude, Adobe, and Google Analytics and other Google services), to support the operation and performance of our online Products and to analyze your interactions and experiences with our Products, including the features you engage with, how you navigate, and your click/touch, movement, scroll, and keystroke activity.

  Interest-Based Advertising
As noted above, on some pages of our websites we allow third-party advertising partners to use cookies, web beacons, and other digital technologies to collect or receive information regarding your activities on those web pages (e.g., your IP address, page(s) visited, time of day, and other identifiers). We may also disclose such information we have collected to Advertising and Analytics Companies. These companies may use this information (and combine it with information collected over time and across other websites, apps, or other digital services) for purposes of delivering targeted advertisements to you to provide measurement services when you use Ford Products, and when you interact with other (non-Ford) websites and online services. This practice is commonly referred to as "interest-based advertising" or “online behavioral advertising”.
You can opt out of certain cookies and other technologies by clicking on the Cookie Settings link in the footer of our websites. You can also learn more by visiting our 
Your Privacy Choices Page
 and the additional information below.
Industry-wide opt-outs. Many advertising and analytics providers are members of associations, which provide a simple way to opt out of analytics and ad targeting, which you can access at:
United States: 
Network Advertising Initiative
 and 
Digital Advertising Alliance
Canada: 
Digital Advertising Alliance of Canada
Europe: 
European Digital Advertising Alliance
Mobile advertising ID controls. Apple and Android mobile devices each generate an advertising identifier that can be accessed by apps and used by advertisers in much the same way that cookies are used on websites. Each operating system provides options to limit tracking and/or reset the advertising ID.
Browser controls. Web browsers vary on whether they are set to accept or allow various types of cookies and similar digital technologies by default. You can go to your browser settings to learn how to delete or reject cookies. If you choose to delete or reject cookies and similar digital technologies, this could affect certain features or services of our website. If you choose to delete digital technologies, settings and preferences controlled by those digital technologies, including advertising preferences, may be deleted and may need to be recreated.
Do Not Track. Some browsers have incorporated “Do Not Track” (DNT) features that can send a signal to the websites you visit indicating you do not wish to be tracked. Because there is not a common understanding of how to interpret the DNT signal, our websites do not currently respond to browser DNT signals. Instead, you can use the range of other tools to control data collection and use, including the cookie controls and advertising controls described above.
Email web beacons. You can disable web beacons in email messages by changing the settings on your email client to prevent the automatic downloading of images.

We also disclose personal information to:
Affiliates. We disclose personal information among the companies within the Ford Motor Company family of companies and affiliates.

                    - If you create a Ford account, we disclose your account credentials within our family of companies so you only need to remember one username and password to access our online and mobile Products (if supported).

Vendors, Suppliers, and Agents. We disclose personal information to vendors or agents working on our behalf for the purposes described in this Notice. In such cases we require them to use it only to perform that work for us and to use adequate safeguards to protect the confidentiality of the personal information they receive.

                    - Social Media Platforms. We disclose hashed emails from our marketing database or other information we have collected as described in this Notice to social media advertising platforms, such as Facebook, so that they can create Custom Audiences and deliver advertisements on our behalf to their users.

                    - In the event of exigent circumstances, to help prevent the loss of life or serious injury or to protect the personal safety of Ford personnel, users of our vehicles, websites, or mobile apps, our visitors, or the public;

Adjustable Shock Absorbers
Rear shock absorbers that provide load leveling without a host of moving parts or an on board air compressor
Internal shock valving senses ride height and uses energy from the vehicle’s motion to increase hydraulic pressure and raise the shock to the desired ride level
As the vehicle is driven, the shocks quickly “pump up” to the necessary pressure, and the vehicle’s original ride level is restored
Aerodynamic Drag
Drag or resistance produced by a moving object, such as a motor vehicle, as it displaces the air in its path
Usually measured in pounds, aerodynamic drag increases in proportion to an object’s frontal area, drag coefficient and the square of its speed
Air Dam
Soft, lower body extension attached below the front bumper improving vehicle performance by limiting the amount of airflow directed under the vehicle
Improves aerodynamics and redirects the airflow to the engine compartment for improved engine cooling or air conditioning performance
Assists in reducing aerodynamic lift, turbulence and drag
Air Dryer
A component of the air conditioning system
Condenses and filters moisture and contaminants from pressurized air from the air compressor
Most air dryers use a drying agent known as a desiccant to remove moisture from the air
Moisture is automatically expelled when the compressor unloads
Air Suspension Seat
Single seat, either driver or passenger, which incorporates an air-activated suspension system to help eliminate the jolts and bounces of the truck cab
Note: Normally air suspension seats require that the truck be equipped with air brakes to supply air to the seat
Some seats feature an integral air compressor so the occupant can energize the seat on vehicles that are not equipped with air brakes
Air/Fuel Mixture
The measure or ratio of the amounts of air and fuel being fed to the engine’s cylinders. The power train control module (PCM) computer adjusts the air/fuel mixture to provide the best combination of performance and fuel efficiency
A higher percentage of fuel to air is described as a rich mixture, while a lower percentage of fuel to air is termed a lean mixture
On Ford vehicles, the air/fuel mixture is measured by an electronic sensor that provides input to the power train control module systems
Airbag
During a moderate-to-severe frontal impact, the airbag is designed to inflate in approximately 1/20th of a second (less time than it takes to blink an eye) and begins to deflate immediately thereafter. In that brief period, the airbag can help reduce the risk of injury to the head and chest of the driver and/or the right front seat passenger
Electronic diagnostic module continuously monitors the airbag for proper operation
When the ignition switch is turned to the ON position, the airbag indicator light on the instrument cluster illuminates for approximately six seconds to signal that the system is functioning properly. Should a fault occur in the system, the airbag indicator light flashes, stays on or fails to illuminate when the ignition switch is turned to the Start position. This signifies immediate service is required
Always put small children and child seats in the rear seating positions (except jump seats). Deactivate the passenger airbag with the airbag shutoff switch (if equipped) when using a rear-facing child safety seat in the front passenger seat
Dual-stage Airbags
Can deploy at two different levels, or nor at all, depending on the information sent to the Restraint Control Module from various sensors located within the vehicle
In less severe collision events, the airbags will deploy in the lower or first stage of deployment force
In more severe collision events, airbags will deploy at both stages or at full force
Seat sensors, in some front passenger seats, can detect the weight of passengers and deploy only if the occupant is above a certain weightSecond Generation Airbags
Designed to inflate with less force than that employed in earlier or first generation designs
The airbags reduce the peak inflation pressure and/or rise rate
Rise rate is the force and speed with which an airbag inflates and is controlled by factors such as the type and amount of inflator gas, the actual airbag size and the design of the vent used to release the pressure from the airbag once deployed
Note: The airbag is not a substitute for safety belts. Safety belts must be properly worn at all times to maximize the effectiveness of the system. Always secure children in the back seat (except jump seats).
All-Wheel Drive (AWD)
Continuously monitors wheel speed, throttle position and steering-wheel angle sensors to determine the vehicle’s conditions and driver’s intent. The system then determines the optimal amount of front and rear torque for the given conditions to not only reduce wheel slip but to prevent the slip from occurring in the first place
Helps ensure the vehicle will be sure-footed on the road in a variety of conditions, such as fast cornering, uneven pavement, potholes, slippery surfaces and anything that compromises traction
Vehicle normally functions in front-wheel-drive mode
When sensors detect that wheel slip is occurring or even just likely to occur, the All-Wheel-Drive (AWD) system can react within as little as 50 milliseconds to distribute up to 100 percent of the available torque to the rear wheels
Controller may detect a difference in wheel speed front-to-rear even in good weather, such as when driving through sand, mud or wet leaves
How the System Works
All-Wheel Drive uses electromagnetic activation of an internal clutch pack
Engages when sensors detect wheel slip in the front wheels, and often acts preemptively to prevent slip from happening in the first place
When activated, the system uses force from an electromagnet to push clutch plates together
Drive shaft torque is transmitted through the unit to the rear wheels, taking power from the front wheel sand sending it to the rear
Benefits of the System
No driver interaction is required to activate AWD. It’s there when your customers need it
The system can send up to 100 percent of the engine’s torque to front or rear as needed to avoid wheel slip
Operates with speed and sophistication to help provide peace of mind and driving confidence
Releases just as quickly, avoiding binding or wheel skid once traction improves
Benefits on either wet or dry pavement. Because the system can transfer torque quickly away from the front wheels, it helps reduce the type of understeer often associated with front-wheel-drive vehicles to provide improved vehicle control
Lightweight with few moving parts, for little impact on fuel economy
When AWD is combined with All-Speed Traction Control or the AdvanceTrac® system, a high degree of torque can be sent to the wheel with the best traction, even if the other three wheels have no traction at all
Alternative Fuel Vehicle (also see E85 Vehicles and Flexible Fuel Vehicle {FFV})
Refers to any type of vehicle that uses nontraditional fuel or power sources:
Methanol/Ethanol
Compressed Natural Gas (CNG)
Propane
Electricity (as in Escape Hybrid)
Alternator
Engine-driven device that converts mechanical energy into alternating electrical current
Provides power to run all of the vehicle’s electrical components when the engine is running
Single or dual heavy-duty alternators that provide additional charging capacity are also available for applications such as cold-climate operation (temperatures below -20°F) where battery drain and accessory use are typically very high, and vehicles are equipped for towing purposes
Alternator Capacity
To determine minimum capacity for an alternator:
Minimum alternator output = Total load x 1.20, where total load comprises continuous night-winter load
Add 20 percent (.20) to accommodate anticipated intermittent load
In most cases, a 2.51:1 or better alternator drive ratio will provide a reasonably adequate system output
Ambient Interior Lighting
Utilizes Light-Emitting Diode (LED) lights to illuminate the vehicle interior: foot wells, cup holders, and controls, depending upon the vehicle
Offers the ability to change color to suit your mood. Color selections include aqua, blue, green, purple, red, yellow or white lighting
Anti-theft Systems
Perimeter anti-theft alarm system
Guards the vehicle's doors, hood and trunk/lift gate. When an unauthorized entry occurs, the system trigger sand will:– Flash the head lamps, parking lamps and theft-indicator lamp on the instrument panel
Sound the horn. Note: It will not be triggered by breaking glass or entry into the vehicle through a window. The perimeter anti-theft alarm system is designed to work with the factory-installed Remote Keyless Entry System. SecuriLock® passive anti-theft ignition system
Uses a sophisticated electronically coded ignition key to start the vehicle. The system is designed to help prevent the engine from being started unless a coded key programmed to the vehicle is used. There is no battery on the key itself; the small amount of energy required to identify the key is supplied by the vehicle
SecuriLock is designed so that it is not necessary for the driver to follow any procedure to arm the system. It is automatically armed when the key is removed from the ignition and is disarmed when the key is reinserted into the ignition
Spare keys will be available from dealerships. Customers can program their keys by using each original (2) key in the proper sequence and finally inserting a new key for programming (see Owner's Guide for more details)
There are billions of possible codes
Auto lamp System
Provides ambient-light-sensitive automatic on-off control of the exterior lights normally controlled by the head lamp control switch
Comes preprogrammed to keep the lights on for approximately 20 seconds after the ignition switch is turned off
If desired, the time delay can be reprogrammed on some vehicles to keep the lights on for up to 3 minutes after the ignition is turned off. See the vehicle Owner’s Guide for more details
Auto lock
Auto lock feature will lock all the doors, lift gate and lift gate window when all doors are closed, the ignition is in the ON position, the vehicle is shifted into any drive gear putting the vehicle in motion
See the vehicle Owner’s Guide for vehicle-specific information on the range of functions
Auxiliary Springs
Used on many light trucks for load stability or to support heavy loads with minimal effect on ride characteristics
Help control roll and sway of trucks with high bodies that carry loads that might shift when cornering or operating on high-crowned roads
Usually used on rear leaf springs, and are mounted to act only after the regular springs are partially deflected under heavy loads
Axle Ratio
The number of output shaft (on front-wheel-drive vehicles) or drive shaft (on rear-wheel-drive vehicles) revolutions required to rotate the axle one full turn
For a rear-wheel-drive vehicle with an axle ratio of 3.55:1, the drive shaft would have to rotate 3.55 times to rotate the rear axle once. This is also known as the Final Drive Ratio
Lower numeric axle ratios tend to be more fuel-efficient. Higher axle ratios deliver added torque for increased power for acceleration and trailer towing
Front-wheel-drive vehicles employ an Axle Transfer Ratio, essentially a Final Drive Ratio
Axle, 2-speed
Type of rear drive axle offering two reduction ratios and a control mechanism for selecting either ratio at the driver’s discretion
"Lo" axle range (the higher numerical ratio) provides maximum pulling power
"Hi" range (the lower numerical ratio) provides maximum road speed
2-speed rear axle permits split-shifting in the lower transmission gears to obtain evenly spaced gear steps that optimize available engine power
2-speed axle can be used in Lo range for crisp performance at slower speeds or in Hi range for maximum economy on the highway
Axles, Rear Drive
Full-floating Rear Axle — Generally used in heavier-duty applications. The full-floating axle shafts “float” within the outer axle housing where they drive the wheels. The outer housing supports the entire rear weight through double-opposed wheel bearings, which absorb all load and wheel stress
Semi-floating Rear Axle — The axle shafts and wheel bearings not only support the total weight, but also transmit driving torque to the wheels. This axle system also resists stress due to skidding, turning corners and other traction forces
See Live Axle for more information

Balance Shaft
Engine shaft designed so it rotates in a way that reduces or cancels out vibrations produced by the engine, resulting in reduced noise, vibration and harshness (NVH) in the passenger compartment
In 4-cylinder engines, two shafts turning in opposite directions on either side of the engine’s crankshaft are generally used, while in V-type engines, a single balance shaft is used
Battery Saver
Feature on some vehicles that automatically turns off interior or under hood lights after a set period of time (e.g., 30–45 minutes), to help prevent battery power drainage and save enough power to restart the vehicle.
Bio-foam Seat Materials
Type of foam used in Mustang and Escape/Escape Hybrid seat production
Production of bio-foam is designed to emit less carbon dioxide into the atmosphere
Material is designed to require less energy to produce than the petroleum-based foam
Emphasizes Ford’s commitment to its environmental responsibility
Body-on-frame Construction
Type of vehicle construction with the body attached to a separate frame, often with rubber mounts to reduce squeaks and rattles, helping to isolate road noise and vibration
Typically more sturdy and robust when compared to vehicles with unibody construction
Provides a solid foundation that contributes to payload and towing capability
Bore and Stroke
While these two terms are frequently used together, they are two totally different measurements
Bore is the measurement of the inside diameter of a cylinder
Stroke is the distance the piston travels from top-dead-center (TDC) to bottom-dead-center (BDC) of the cylinder
Box Side Steps
Frame-mounted steps located on each side of the truck cargo box and in front of the rear wheel well used to make it easy to access the cargo box. Able to support up to 500 lbs.
Allow convenient side access to the cargo box using a release lever located on the step
Return to stowage position by pushing the steps back into/under the cargo box
Boxed Frame
As the name implies, a "boxed" frame has four sides, which provides additional strength. It is a closed structural section that has greater resistance to twisting and torsion forces than comparably sized "open" frame designs.
Brake Bias
Front/rear distribution of a vehicle’s braking power. Generally the front of a vehicle where the engine and majority of weight and steering functions are located supplies the greater amount of braking power.
Brake Modulation
The process of varying pedal pressure to hold a vehicle on the verge of lockup to supply maximum braking efficiency. Anti-lock Braking Systems (ABS) employ computer-controlled modulators to maximize braking efficiency.
Brake/Shift Interlock (Automatic Transmissions)
Requires driver to depress the brake pedal in order to shift out of Park and into any gear
Prevents accidental engagement of drive gears
Vehicles with a floor-mounted gearshift lever include a manual override in the console; vehicles with a column-mounted gearshift include a manual override under the steering column
Braking Systems
Ford Motor Company uses a number of different braking systems on its passenger cars, crossovers, SUVs and light trucks, including the following: Four-wheel Anti-lock Braking System (ABS)
Helps provide straight, more controlled stops, while helping the driver maintain steering control undermost road conditions, including slippery road surfaces
ABS computer-controlled sensors prevent wheels from locking up, even when the driver presses hard on the brake pedal
Sensors continuously monitor the speed of each wheel. When impending wheel lockup is detected, the computer signals the hydraulic control unit to apply and release (automatically “pumping”) the brakes several times per second with split-second timing, providing a level of braking efficiency that even professional race car drivers cannot duplicate and resulting in shorter stopping distances and greater braking and steering control
Three-channel ABS
Uses three individual channels to monitor and control brake pressure to the front wheels individually and to both rear wheels together
Four-channel ABS
Operates similarly to the three-channel system, except that both rear wheels are monitored and operated separately
ABS Functionality
Computer continuously monitors the ABS for malfunctions. Should a problem develop, an instrument panel light alerts the driver that the ABS computer has shut down and the brakes have been returned to normal, non-ABS operation
Driver should never pump the brakes in a vehicle equipped with ABS. This defeats the system and increases stopping distances. For best performance, the driver should apply maximum pedal pressure
When using ABS, the driver may feel a slight pulsing sensation; this is completely normal
Dual Diagonal Braking System
All Ford vehicles feature either a diagonal or front-rear split hydraulic brake system with warning lamp (excluding F-650/F-750 with air brakes)
With this system, diagonal circuits link front and rear wheels at opposite corners, so braking capacity is retained even if one of the two circuits malfunctions
Power-assisted Four-wheel Disc Brakes
Four-wheel disc brakes consist of a disc at each wheel that rotates at wheel speed and is straddled by a caliper that squeezes the inner and outer faces of the disc to provide stopping or braking power
Disc brakes provide a more linear response, and therefore operate more efficiently at high temperatures than drum brakes
Power-assisted disc brakes use a vacuum-assist to provide power to the master cylinder, thereby greatly reducing pedal effort
Ford power-assisted disc brakes are self-adjusting with pad clearance automatically maintained by the limited retracting action of the piston in the caliper Power-assisted Front Disc/Rear Drum Brakes Combination of the front disc and rear drum brake system. Drum brakes are a type of brake that has an iron casting shaped like a shallow drum that rotates with the wheel. Curved brake shoes are forced into contact with the inner face of the drum to provide stopping or braking power. Power-assisted drum brakes use a vacuum-assist to provide power to the master cylinder, thereby greatly reducing pedal effort. Features of this system include:
Front disc brake pad clearance automatically maintained by the limited retracting action of the piston in the caliper
Adjustment of the rear drum brakes is accomplished when the brake pedal is applied while the vehicle is moving in Reverse
Both front and rear brakes are self-adjusting
Note: Availability of braking systems varies according to model. Refer to the individual vehicle sections of the 2009Source Books or to the Ordering Guide for specific availability.

Point at which the entire weight of a body is considered to be concentrated so that, if supported at this point, the body would remain in equilibrium in any position.
Charge Motion Control Valves
Electronically controlled metal flap located at the end of each intake runner
These flaps are specially shaped to speed up the intake charge at low engine speed and induce a tumble effecting the combustion chamber that results in a more thorough fuel/air mixture and quicker, more efficient burn
At higher engine speed the flaps are completely open and do not affect the intake charge
Chassis
Portion of the vehicle that includes:
Suspension
Steering components
Power train
Brakes
Fuel system Refer to the Power trains section of this book for details concerning Ford power train systems.
Chassis Cab
Unfinished truck featuring an occupant compartment, or cab, without a cargo bed

Climate-controlled Seats
Feature a tiny thermoelectric device that allows the occupant to cool or warm the seat and backrest depending on outdoor temperature and personal preference
The thermoelectric modules are solid-state devices with surfaces that turn hot or cold depending on the polarity of the applied direct current electricity
Heat-transfer components attached to the modules cool or heat the air that is blown past them and then is circulated through ducts and pads in the seats and onto the occupants
Each seat has individual electronic controls to adjust the level of cooling or heating desired
Clutch
Mechanical device that engages and disengages the engine from the transmission/Trans axle during shifting, operated by a pedal to the left of the brake pedal
Depressing the clutch pedal interrupts power flow to the transmission/Trans axle. Releasing the clutch pedal with the gearshift in place will reengage the transmission/trans axle

Gives the driver and front passenger a "commanding" seating position for comfort and excellent visibility and helps provide drivers a better view of the road due to the raised seat design
This is achieved partly by raising the seat's hip pivot point
Makes getting into and out of the seats easier
Compression Ratio
Ratio between the engine cylinder volume (including the cylinder head volume) when the piston is at the bottom of its stroke and the engine cylinder volume when the piston is at the top of its stroke.
Connecting Rod
Mechanical link between the piston and the crankshaft that enables the piston’s up-and-down travel to be converted into the crankshaft's rotational motion
Some Ford engines use forged, powdered-metal, cracked connecting rods. These connecting rods are manufactured using a process pioneered by Ford
Connecting rods are typically forged from a flat or round metal billet. Powdered-metal rods, however, begin as loose metal powder blended to the required composition and forged in a form that is nearly at the final "net shape"
Constant Velocity (CV) Joint (Front-wheel-drive Vehicles)
Refined version of a universal joint, typically used on front-wheel-drive vehicles or rear independent suspensions of rear-wheel-drive vehicles to help reduce vibrations inherent in normal universal joints

Cowl
Horizontal portion of the vehicle body behind the engine and immediately to the rear of the hood and under the windshield.
Crankshaft
Primary shaft in the engine that converts the up-and-down motion of the pistons into rotary motion
Crankshaft forces the pistons, via the connecting rods, upward to compress the air/fuel mixture prior to combustion. The combustion of the fuel then forces the piston downward, causing the crankshaft to rotate
Crankshaft is connected to the flywheel and clutch or torque converter flex plate, which transmits power to the transmission
Cross member

Electric rear-window defroster features a silver-filled ceramic heating grid silk-screened on the inside of the glass and includes an instrument panel indicator light and a timer for automatic shutoff
Lines in the heating grid are widely spaced so they do not interfere with rear vision
Detonation
Also known as engine knocking or pre-ignition
Detonation is caused by ignition of the air/fuel mixture in the combustion chamber independent of the spark plug firing
This condition is an engine malfunction and can often be eliminated by a regular tune-up or use of proper grade fuel
See Knock Sensor for more information
Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF)
Located in the exhaust system after the diesel oxidation catalyst
"Scrubs" the particulates in the exhaust gases by trapping them after they have left the combustion chamber
Periodically cleans itself through a process known as "regeneration" which is a process similar to a small incinerator that burns off the trapped particles
Passive generation burns off soot naturally when exhaust temperatures are high enough
Active regeneration (forced burn-off) occurs as needed depending on operational use
Differential
System of gears in the final drive assembly of a vehicle to transmit torque to the driving wheels regardless of whether the vehicle is moving straight ahead or turning a corner
Differential allows the wheels to turn at different speeds while delivering equal torque
When cornering, the driving wheel on the inside of the turn travels in a smaller radius than the outside wheel to prevent the outside wheel from dragging in the turn
Displacement, Engine
Engine displacement is the measure of the total cylindrical volume through which the pistons of an engine move from one end of the stroke to the other. The formula to determine the displacement of an engine is: Displacement = .7854 x Bore x Bore x Stroke x Number of Cylinders. For example: The displacement of the 4.6L V8 engine is: 280.3 (0.7854 x 3.55 x 3.55 x 3.54 x 8).
Dive
Dipping of a vehicle's nose that occurs when the brakes are applied and the load is transferred from the rear to the front suspension.
Domestic Content

This label communicates:
Vehicle line average percentage (value-based) of domestic content (U.S. and Canadian)
Names of at least two of the countries (if any) providing15 percent or more (by value) of all components
City and country of final assembly
The country of origin of the engine and transmission/transaxle
Drag Coefficient (Cd)
Measure of a vehicle's efficiency as an aerodynamic shape, useful for comparison with other vehicle designs
A mathematical factor that, when multiplied by the projected square footage area of the vehicle, gives its drag force in pounds
Cd is derived by measuring the drag force and dividing it by the product of dynamic pressure and vehicle frontal area
Drag coefficient (Cd) = force/dynamic pressure x frontal area; the lower the Cd number, the better the aerodynamic efficiency
Drive line
Components that connect the transmission/transaxle to the driving axle, including the universal/constant velocity joints and drive shaft/half shafts.
Drive shaft
Shaft that transmits power from the transmission to the axle differential assembly on rear-wheel-drive vehicles.

E85 Vehicles
E85 vehicles are also called Flexible Fuel Vehicles (FFV) due to their ability to operate on a blend of85 percent ethanol fuel and 15 percent unleaded gasoline
Ethanol is derived primarily from corn but can be made from virtually any starch feed stock such as sugarcane, wheat or barley. Because it is produced from crops, it is a renewable fuel and reduces dependence on imported oil
Current Ford vehicles with FFV capability are: Focus – 2.0L I4, Explorer – 3.5L V6, Taurus – 3.5L V6, F-150 – 3.7L V6, 5.0L V8, Expedition - 5.4L V8, Navigator - 5.4L V8, E-Series – 4.6L V8, 5.4L V8, Super Duty Pickup and Chassis Cab – 6.2L V8
See Flexible Fuel Vehicle (FFV)
Easy Fuel TM Cap less Fuel Filler System

Includes an emergency funnel (stored near spare tire jack) that must be used with the Easy Fuel system to accept fuel from a gas can or other secondary refueling device
Eco-friendly Seating Fabric
Seat fabric manufactured from 100 percent postindustrial polyester fabric that would have been previously disposed of as scrap
Emphasizes Ford’s commitment to its environmental responsibility
Electronic Automatic Temperature Control (EATC)
A climate control system that automatically maintains a specified cabin temperature using either air conditioning or heat. The system automatically sets the blower speed and displays desired temperature set points. It offers manual controls to override automatic settings when necessary.
Electronic Brake Force Distribution (EBD)
Automatically optimizes the front-to-rear brake force distribution to reduce the tendency of rear wheel lockup, especially when the vehicle is unloaded. Effective in braking conditions before ABS operates, EBD also eliminates the need for a hydraulic brake-proportioning valve.
Electronic Fuel Injection (EFI)
A modern, efficient method of fuel delivery that replaced carburetors in all Ford passenger cars and light trucks with gasoline engines
EFI precisely controls the amount of fuel used and improves the dispersion of fuel in the air charge, improving drive ability, fuel economy and performance of the engine
Variations of EFI used in Ford vehicles include: Multi-port Electronic Fuel Injection (MEFI)Also known as “direct port” injection, MEFI uses individual port-mounted injectors to deliver fuel directly to the intake inlet for each cylinder. This more even distribution of fuel improves power balance between the cylinders, maximizes combustion efficiency and improves drive ability and performance. The system “squirts” fuel into each cylinder with every revolution of the crankshaft. Sequential Multi-port Electronic Fuel Injection (SEFI)Specific type of multi-port injection that delivers fuel in more precisely timed pulses corresponding to the opening of each intake valve, SEFI takes advantage of the atomized fuel spray from the injectors to achieve a more precise combustion for better performance, often with improved fuel economy.
Electronic Ignition
Ford Motor Company designed-and-built electronic ignition is standard on all domestic gasoline engines. The system is either an:
Electronic Ignition (EI) System, or
Integrated Electronic Ignition (EI) System — coil-on-plug (COP)
Electronic Throttle Control (ETC)
Also known as "Drive-by-Wire."
ETC translates accelerator motions and other inputs into control of engine power
The accelerator pedal controls the throttle by means of a computer-controlled stepping motor in lieu of a conventional linkage from pedal to throttle
It works by integrating throttle movements with the vehicle’s electronically controlled functions such as cruise control or idle speed
Enhances control, drive ability and performance
Emissions Standards
All vehicles sold by an auto maker must meet a U.S. EPA Federal fleet average of Tier 2 Bin 5. Each California Emissions State must meet a different fleet average
California uses the Low Emissions Vehicle grading system while EPA has chosen to categorize emissions standards into a "Tier and Bin" system
Energy-absorbing Steering Column
In all passenger cars and light trucks sold in the U.S., energy-absorbing steering columns are designed to collapse in the event of occupant contact in a frontal collision, reducing the potential head and chest injuries to the driver.
Engine Exhaust Brake
System added to a diesel engine that allows the driver to energize an engine-derived vehicle retardation system. Some engine brakes use compression pressures while the most common are those that employ engine exhaust. In either case, the principle is to let the engine help retard the vehicle speed, thus saving on wheel brake wear.
Engines — Diesel
Ford diesel engines provide certain advantages for some applications, including many truck applications. Diesel engines use no spark plugs, require a lower rpm range to produce peak power (especially torque) output and produce higher torque than horsepower for optimized towing performance. Additionally, diesel engines deliver more efficient fuel economy than gasoline engines and maximize fuel efficiency at idle, making them ideal for tasks requiring prolonged idle time. In a diesel engine:
Diesel fuel is compressed until it reaches a temperature hot enough for combustion
Glow plugs are used to preheat the air in the cylinders and to ensure easy starting on cold days
Heavier-weight components are used in some areas to handle the higher compression ratio — generally more than twice that of gasoline engines
Engines — Gasoline
There are two types of piston configurations available on Ford passenger cars and light trucks: In-line (I-4) and V-type (V6, V8 or V10).In-line engine — has all of the cylinders in a single line with the pistons moving vertically in the cylinders.
Pairs of pistons are located 180 degrees of crankshaft revolution from one another in an in-line 4-cylinder engine
V-angle engine — has cylinder banks formed in a V-type engine design, measured in degrees.
A 60-degree V6 is narrow by design and has excellent natural balance characteristics
Engine vibration is reduced as the number of cylinders is increased, whatever the V-angle, because the impulse of each cylinder firing occurs more frequently
EPA Fuel Economy Ratings
Fuel economy is measured under controlled conditions in a laboratory using a standardized test procedure specified by federal law and implemented by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Manufacturers test their own vehicles— usually preproduction prototypes —and report the results to the EPA. The EPA reviews the results and confirms about 10–15 percent of them through their own tests at the National Vehicles and Fuel Emissions Laboratory. Vehicle is driven on a roller dynamometer (the vehicle remains stationary while the driven wheels are allowed to roll) and a hose is connected to the tailpipe to collect engine exhaust. The carbon in the exhaust is measured to calculate the amount of fuel burned during the test. This is more accurate than using calculations based on distance traveled and the amount of fuel consumed. Five separate test schedules are driven to simulate the driving conditions of city, highway, and hot weather with air conditioning on, high-speed driving and acceleration, and cold weather environments. The latter three tests are new for 2008 model year vehicles and will likely result in a decrease in mpg versus the same model tested under the pre-2008 test procedure. Driving cycles: City — 23 stops with accelerations to 20–60 mph. Highway — approximately 13 minutes of mixed rural and interstate driving with speeds ranging from30 to 60 mph. High Speed — aggressive accelerations to speeds of up to 80 mph with six minutes of driving 60–80 mph. Air Conditioning — 10 minutes of accelerations to varying speeds up to 60 mph with the air conditioning on while the vehicle is in an environment of 95 degrees and approximately 40 percent relative humidity.

Glad Hand
Quick-release couplings, attached to the tractor cab, that connect the tractor brake hoses to the trailer
These couplings open the supply line when twisted together and close the line when twisted apart to prevent the loss of air pressure
Glass, Solar-tinted
Automotive window glass with construction that helps prevent ultraviolet ray penetration of the passenger compartment
Solar-tinted glass helps reduce heat buildup in the interior of the vehicle by blocking out a significant portion of the solar energy. It accomplishes this not by reflecting the rays, but by absorbing the radiation and reradiating the majority of it to the exterior of the vehicle
Grade ability
Grade-climbing ability is the percent of grade a vehicle will climb with a given load
A 1 percent grade is equivalent to a rise of 1 foot in a horizontal distance of 100 feet; a 2 percent grade is a2-foot rise in a horizontal distance of 100 feet, etc.
Grade-climbing ability will affect a vehicle’s performance and should be considered when determining payload or trailer towing requirements
On steeper grades, a vehicle will be under more stress to handle these heavy requirements
GVVW (Gross Vehicle Weight)

Strongly recommended below -20°F
Height-Adjustable Safety Belt
Multiple-position front-seat shoulder safety belt anchor that is height adjustable to allow a comfortable and proper fit of the outboard safety belts.
High-Intensity Discharge (HID) Head lamps
HID lighting systems use a special quartz bulb with no filament
Bulb is filled primarily with xenon gas along with a small amount of mercury and other metal salts
Bulb features two electrodes separated by a small gap (about 4mm or 3/16th inch). When high voltage current is applied to the electrodes, it excites the gases inside the bulb and forms an electrical arc between the electrodes
Hot ionized gas produces a "plasma discharge" which generates an intense, bluish-white light
Because there is no brittle filament inside a xenon HID bulb to break or burn out, the head lamps typically last up to three times longer than halogen head lamps (3000 hours versus 1000 hours of continuous operation, which is equivalent to 5 to 10 years of normal driving)
Horsepower
Amount of power needed to lift a 550-lb. object at a rate of one foot in one second
Horsepower is expressed as the torque in lb.-ft. times the number of revolutions per minute divided by the constant 5252:
Gross horsepower is obtained by a dynamometer test of an engine equipped only with the built-in accessories essential to its operation, such as fuel pump, oil pump, coolant pump and built-in emissions-control equipment
Net horsepower is obtained by a dynamometer test of a complete engine equipped with all the accessories necessary to perform its intended functions unaided, including the air-intake system, exhaust system, cooling system, generator, starter and emissions-control equipment
Torque is what gets a vehicle moving, and horsepower is the force required to keep a vehicle moving once torque has started the vehicle moving from a standstill

Integrated Trailer Brake Controller
Electronic or electro hydraulic device installed in a tow vehicle used to activate the braking system of the trailer being towed. Controller uses actual braking pressure of the tow vehicle to calculate how much braking force to apply to the trailer. Most after market add-on controllers use a timer or proportional load basis to calculate the amount of brake force required. Since the Ford trailer brake controller is fully integrated into the truck’s onboard computer, this is the first and only controller able to adapt its output based on the status of the Anti-lock Braking System (ABS) to help provide more controlled, stable stops. Trailer brake controller is also fully integrated into the instrument panel design for the convenience of the driver during hookup and operation.
Integrated Wheel End (IWE) System
Provides Expedition with an outstanding four-wheel-drive system. The system is vacuum operated. In two-wheel-drive mode, a vacuum is applied to withdraw the clutch ring from the wheel hub coupler, completely separating the axle shaft from the wheel end. This avoids "back driving" the axle shafts, resulting in less wear and drag and slightly improved fuel economy. In four-wheel-drive mode the vacuum is shut off, the clutch ring engages the wheel hub coupler, and the axle shaft and hub are locked together to provide the necessary additional traction.
Inter cooler
Used on supercharged and turbo charged vehicles, the inter cooler is mounted at the front of the vehicle in the air stream and cools the compressed intake air as it flows over fins and plates inside the inter cooler. The inter cooler removes heat (produced by supercharging/turbo charging) from the compressed air before it enters the engine's intake system. This action generates a denser, cooler intake charge and increases the engine’s ability to produce horsepower and torque. Inter cooling also increases the detonation threshold of the engine because of the cooler air charge, meaning the engine can be run with more ignition advance for higher performance, or run lower octane fuel before experiencing detonation. The cooler intake air also allows the engine to run slightly cooler, reducing the chance of overheating.
Inter cooling
System for cooling pressurized intake air to obtain improved combustion efficiency and fuel economy
The cooling process increases the density of the intake charge, promoting more thorough combustion with reduced emissions

Lockup Torque Converter
Because the automatic transmission is linked to the engine by a fluid coupling, rather than by the mechanical clutch of a manual transmission, there is a potential loss of efficiency due to slippage. The lockup torque converter improves fuel economy by eliminating this slippage. An internal clutch system provides a positive, direct connection between the engine and transmission. It is usually controlled by the power train computer and will operate only after the vehicle has moved away from a stop or shifted out of low gear.

Octane Rating
Octane is the measure of gasoline’s ability to resist auto-ignition, which can cause engine knock
Two laboratory test methods measure gasoline octane value
Research Octane Number (RON)
Motor Octane Number (MON)
RON correlated best with low-speed, mild engine knocking conditions
MON correlates with high-temperature engine knocking conditions with part-throttle operation
North America typically uses the Anti-Knock Index of (RON + MON)/2 to specify octane rating
Vehicles are designed and calibrated to a certain octane value
When a customer uses gasoline with an octane level lower than specified, engine knock may result and could lead to service engine damage

Partial Zero Emissions Vehicle (PZEV)
120,000 miles of driving. By comparison, a vehicle certified to the Federal Tier 2 Bin 5 California LEV II emissions standards currently in effect emits about 29 pounds over the same 120,000 miles. To achieve a PZEV rating, a vehicle must meet certain criteria, including:
Meet the Super Ultra Low Emissions Vehicle (SULEV II) standards for tailpipe pollution
Demonstrate zero fuel-based evaporative emissions
The manufacturer’s warranty must ensure that emissions-related components are covered for 15 years or 150,000 miles, whichever comes first(1)
Payload
Weight of the actual cargo and occupant(s) carried by a vehicle
Payload capacities are computed by subtracting the curb weight of the vehicle from its specified Gross Vehicle Weight Rating (GVWR)
Addition of any optional equipment or passengers adds to the vehicle weight and subtracts from the allowable payload
Trucks with a GVWR of Class 6 or higher calculate payload by simply subtracting the weight of the completed vehicle from the GVWR to determine payload
Pillars
Pillars are the vertical beams that support the roof and separate passenger compartment windows. A-pillar — First, or most forward, roof support pillar located on either side of the windshield. Also known as "windshield pillar" or "A-post" B-pillar — Center roof support that divides the front and rear doors on 4-door and passenger wagon models. On2-door models, the B-pillar separates the door and rear quarter window/panel. On vans and passenger wagons, the B-pillar is behind the front doors C-pillar — Rear roof supporting member on most vehicles. On CUVs/SUVs, this pillar separates the rear doors and quarter panel glass D-pillar — Vertical, or sometimes diagonal, roof support member at the extreme rear of the roof or greenhouse structure on mini vans, CUVs/SUVs and some sedan body styles

Unit of measure for engine torque commonly abbreviated as lb.-ft. The commonly used term of “foot-pounds” is more properly a measurement of work rather than torque.
Power Adjustable Brake and Accelerator Pedals
Power adjustable pedals allow for the forward or rearward adjustment (up to 3 inches) of the accelerator and brake pedals through the activation of an instrument-panel-mounted switch. This is an especially useful feature for drivers of smaller stature, allowing them to comfortably reach the pedals while being able to maintain the required distance from the steering-wheel-mounted airbag. This feature can be packaged together with an available seat position memory system on certain vehicles for the ultimate in comfort and convenience.
Power Band
Rpm range over which an engine delivers a substantial portion of its peak power. The power band generally extends from slightly below the engine’s torque peak to slightly above its power peak.
Power Takeoff (PTO)
Power takeoff refers to using the vehicle’s power train as a power source to perform some work other than moving the vehicle. Examples of this work include operating auxiliary equipment such as a wrecker and snowplow lifts, dump bodies, hydraulic/pneumatic tools and so on. The PTO unit is located between the power train and the device it powers. When a vehicle is doing this work while it is not moving, keep in mind that it is also deprived of the cooling benefits airflow provides. Because of this, it is important not to block the front grille or bumper openings. Specific precautions are listed in the Body Builders Layout Book. While Ford does not offer the actual PTO units, Ford F-Series Super Duty® engineers worked closely with two PTO after market suppliers (Parker Chelsea and Muncie) during development of the truck. This work helped create two different Ford-specific after market units that bolt directly onto the transmission’s power takeoff interface (the interface is standard on F-Series Super Duty models equipped with a manual transmission, optional with automatic transmission).
Power Takeoff (PTO) Provision
Power Takeoff (PTO) Provision is an added benefit for customers with specific auxiliary power needs. It enables up fitters to supply auxiliary power to hydraulically driven accessories such as dump bodies, sprayers, pumps, generators, etc. Front-mounted, front-powered equipment is often powered by a direct drive shaft from the front of the engine. The adaptation of the vehicle to allow this installation is called the Power Takeoff Provision. This includes an adapter plate on the engine, and in some instances clearance through the grille or front-end sheet metal. An optional front frame extension for mounting equipment is available on all models except the Pro Loader. The F-650 and F-750extensions are bolted on, while the F-750S extension has an integral extension of the frame rail.
Transmission Power Takeoff Provision– A specific option code must be ordered to get a PTO gear and port with the TorqShift® 5-speed automatic transmission

62R for F-Series Super Duty®
44B for LCF– The 6-speed manual overdrive transmission has a PTO gear and a port standard (NA on E-Series and LCF)
Stationary Elevated Idle Control (SEIC)– This standard feature in all E-350/E-450, F-250/F-350/F-450/F-550 and Ford LCF models provides the "throttle-kicker," replacing the Auxiliary Idle Control Kit in prior model years. It consists of a strategy embedded in the power train control module (PCM), and a set of blunt-cut wires to command it– The selling dealer will need to obtain the customer interface (e.g., PTO controller or switch) from the aftermarket NOTE: "Up fitter Switches,"(Standard on F-350/F-450/F-550 Chassis Cabs, option code 66Son F-250/F-350 Pickups) may be used as a PTO switch. SEIC provides engine speeds of 910 to 2400 rpm for 5.4L and 6.8L gas engines, and 1200 to 2400 rpm for all (4.5L, 6.0L and 6.4L) diesel engines. It also automatically locks the torque converter providing power to the PTO gear for the TorqShift automatic transmission when the operator turns on the PTO switch. Instructions to up fitters for completing the SEIC/PTO circuitry are detailed in the 2008 Model Year Light Truck Body Builders Layout Book, found at www.fleet.ford.com/truckbbas. Refer to the latest Dealer Ordering Guide for model and engine restrictions.
Power train
Name given to the combination of engine, transmission/transaxle and differential (rear-wheel drive only) for any particular model. See the Power trains section of this book for details concerning Ford power train systems.
Power train Control Module (PCM) with On-Board Diagnostics (OBD II)
PCM with OBD II was developed to accommodate the goals of achieving mandated emissions control and improving vehicle performance
The latest PCM incorporates more functions, more memory and more new integrated circuits than the former control system, helping it be more precise than its predecessors PCM features and benefits:
Potential improvements in:– Performance– Drive ability– Fuel economy– Emissions control
Through state-of-the-art technologies, Ford Service Technicians are able to fully reprogram the PCM memory by electronically “talking” to a single connector on the vehicle, allowing the module to receive upgrades rather than requiring replacement
PCM system enables Ford vehicles to comply with the latest California Air Resources Board (CARB) OBD II requirements designed to help maintain vehicle emissions control. As more stringent emissions regulations are adopted in the future, the PCM will be able to adapt to these as well PCM enables Ford to meet OBD II requirements by monitoring:
Catalyst efficiency
Fuel system
Evaporative emissions
Exhaust gas recirculation
Other emissions-related control systems as well as various sensors and actuators The PCM also helps improve accuracy during repair procedures. The PCM’s enhanced capability expands the ability of Ford Service Technicians to trace problems, even intermittent problems, quickly and easily.
Through the use of diagnostic scan tools, Technicians also are able to retrieve recorded vehicle performance history from PCM, leading to quicker and more accurate diagnoses
Power-to-weight Ratio
Although power-to-weight ratios may be configured in many ways, they are generally the proportion of the vehicle's curb weight divided by the vehicle’s horsepower measured at peak rpm. A vehicle that produces more horsepower or torque than another vehicle of equal weight will have a greater power-to-weight ratio.
PSI

Maximum recommended engine revolutions per minute (rpm). A tachometer, standard or available on some models, displays a red area to alert the driver that the engine speed is beyond the recommended rate.
Resisting Bending Moment (RBM)
Result of multiplying yield strength and section modulus when comparing frames of the same material, the one with the largest section modulus will be the strongest. When comparing frames of different materials, the frame with the highest RBM has the greater strength.
Reverse Sensing System (Reverse Vehicle Aid Sensor)
Helps audibly alert drivers of certain objects close to the rear of the vehicle (within approximately 6 feet) as the driver backs the vehicle up slowly. As the vehicle approaches an object, a warning tone beeps. The beeps increase in frequency as the vehicle gets closer to the object, until it becomes a continuous tone at less than approximately 10 inches from the object
System activates automatically when the vehicle is shifted into Reverse. Pressing a switch on the instrument panel will turn the system off. An "Off" light on the switch illuminates to indicate the system is not active. The system reactivates when the vehicle is again placed in Reverse
Reverse Sensing System (Reverse Vehicle Aid Sensor) cont'd
Customer Benefits
Helps make getting in and out of tight parking spaces easier. The system:
Detects what the driver may not see, such as other vehicles, fences, walls, concrete posts, plant containers ,fire hydrants and the like
Enables drivers to use better judgment in tight parking situations
Provides information to drivers to help reduce damage from hitting objects at low speeds (90 percent of backup collisions are at speeds less than 5 mph)
How It Works
Four ultrasonic sensors in the vehicle’s rear bumper transmit signals
When the signals contact an object, they bounce back to the sensors on the vehicle
Within milliseconds, the system calculates the distance to the object, based on the time it took the signal to travel from the object back to the sensor
If the distance is within approximately 6 feet, the alert is sounded
System continues to send out and monitor signals, adjusting the warning beep according to the object’s distance from the vehicle
Ride Height
Distance between the ground and a specified point on the vehicle body with properly inflated tires. The lowest point of the bumper is generally used as the vehicle measuring point.
Rigid Axle
Simple non-independent suspension consisting of a rigid transverse member with wheel hubs that are solidly bolted to it. The axle can be attached to the vehicle body by leaf springs or by a combination of suspension arms and links. See Hotchkiss-Design Rear Axle.
Ring-and-pinion Gear
Set that uses a small gear (the pinion gear) to turn a larger diameter annular gear (the ring gear).
Road holding
Ability of the vehicle to maintain traction with, or grip, the pavement while cornering.
  Roll
Rotation along an imaginary axis running the length of the vehicle between the driver's-side and passenger's-side wheels. Roll causes the vehicle to tilt or lean left or right. A stabilizer bar can often counteract the effects of roll.
rpm
Revolutions per minute, the number of engine crankshaft rotations completed in one minute. Configured in thousands, a tachometer will report the engine’s rpm to the driver and help alert the driver as to when proper shifting is required.

Safety Belt Energy Management Retractors
See page 5-10 in the Safety section of this book.
Safety Belts
System of belts or harnesses designed to restrain and help reduce the risk of injury to occupants in the event of side, rear, rollover or frontal collisions. Refer to the Safety section of this book for details concerning Ford safety belt systems.
Safety Cell Construction
Integrated body structure designed to work as a system to provide protection for occupants. Its major design features include:
Front-end structure with a reinforced sub frame to provide energy absorption
Cross cowl beam that helps provide an additional mounting point for the steering column and airbag mountings, reducing their movement in the event of a frontal impact
High-strength side door intrusion beams
Sheet metal at the front and rear corners that collapses progressively and predictably to dissipate some of the energy of an impact
Seats, Hi-back
Back of this individual seat is about as high as the top of the occupant’s head. It tapers in from shoulder height to form an integral head restraint.
Section Modulus
Measure of the strength of frame side rails determined by the cross-section area and shape of the side rails. When comparing frames of the same material, the one with the largest section modulus will be the strongest. When comparing frames of different materials, the frame with the highest Resisting Bending Moment (RBM) has the greater strength.
Self-adjusting Clutch
Optional self-adjusting clutch, once installed, does not have to be adjusted again. When the release bearing travel exceeds 1/2-inch, the self-adjusting mechanism returns the clutch and pedal free play to normal operating conditions as the clutch pedal is actuated. A self-adjusting clutch eliminates eight to ten clutch adjustments over the life of a clutch.
Sequential Multi-port Electronic Fuel Injection (SEFI)
Specific type of multi-port injection that delivers fuel in more precisely timed pulses corresponding to the opening of each intake valve. SEFI takes advantage of the atomized fuel spray from the injectors to achieve a more precise combustion for better performance, often with improved fuel economy.
Shock Absorber
Provides mechanical or hydraulic friction to control deflection of automobile springs
Oil in the shocks is forced through small passages to absorb the force of a road shock
Pressurized gas is used in many shock absorbers to prevent aeration of the oil. This reduces the tendency of the shock to overheat on rough road surfaces
Short- and Long-Arm (SLA) Suspension
Independent design that allows either wheel to react to road imperfections with minimal effect on the opposite wheel. Several distinct advantages over MacPherson struts include camber control, turning geometry and lower component package height. These advantages permit a lower hood line. Major design features include:
Gas-pressurized shock absorbers to maintain optimum ride control over a variety of road surfaces
Control arms to help absorb braking and acceleration forces
Coil springs or torsion bars (on select vehicles)
Single Overhead Camshaft (SOHC) Design
Engine design with the camshaft located atop the cylinder head, operating both the intake and exhaust valves. SOHC V6 and V8 engines, which are designed with cylinders in two banks, have a total of two cams, one for each cylinder head. The one cam in each head operates the intake and exhaust valves, resulting in improved performance and fuel efficiency. All engines using the overhead cam design offer the potential for greater power output and higher engine speeds (rpm) when compared with overhead valve designs.

Skid pad
Large, flat expanse of smooth pavement used for various handling tests, e.g., road holding. Generally, road holding is measured as the highest speed a vehicle can maintain without losing adhesion while maintaining the given diameter of a large circle (e.g., 250 feet, 300 feet, etc.) or the g-force generated at that speed.
Skid plate
Deflector plate under a vehicle that helps provide protection from off-road debris. Transfer case and fuel tank skid plates are common on Ford 4x4 vehicles.
Slack Adjusters (automatic/manual)
All Ford air brake trucks come equipped with automatic slack adjusters
When properly maintained, slack adjusters retain accurate shoe-to-drum clearances (slack)
This promotes even brake wear, reducing brake downtime and expense
Properly adjusted brakes are a plus factor for vehicle safety
Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE)
The organization that sets American automotive standards for automotive measurements, including horsepower, torque and lubricants.
Split-port Induction (SPI)
Most split-port induction systems have a dual-runner engine intake design promoting high-volume/high-velocity airflow to increase engine performance.
Dual-runner design features long, small-diameter runners tuned for low engine rpm torque and short, large-diameter runners tuned for high rpm horsepower
Runner usage is controlled by the electronic engine controls and integral throttle-body valves
SPI engines use a cylinder head with two runners per cylinder. These runners carry the air charge to the intake side of the combustion chamber. At lower engine speeds, the air charge is directed through a narrow pathway that results in a higher air velocity, quickening engine response. As engine speed increases above 3000 rpm, the second path works to further enhance engine power and operating efficiency
Spring Rating
Any one of several methods of describing spring ratings currently used in the light truck industry, including:
Rating at Pad — The amount of weight above the pad that can actually be supported by the springs, including the chassis, body and payload weights
Rating at Ground — Includes the Rating at Pad plus the weight of components between the spring and ground (axle, brakes, tires and wheels)
Sprung Weight — The weight of those components supported by the spring, such as the frame, engine, body, payload, etc.
Unsprung Weight — The portion of the weight of the chassis (i.e., axle, wheels, tires, brakes, etc.) not supported by the springs, as well as one-half the weight of the springs and drive shaft
Stabilizer Bar
Bar or tube that provides added support for suspension members to minimize body lean or roll. The stabilizer is transversely mounted and used at the front and/or rear suspension to resist unequal vertical motion across the width of the vehicle.

Essentially, a rack-and-pinion system as described previously with a power-assist feature reducing steering effort
Major design features include:– Rack-and-pinion gears that are engineered for low turning effort, good return ability and handling– Lightweight power steering pump– Power assist
Speed-sensitive, Variable-assist Steering
Major design features include:– A microprocessor-controlled system that electronically varies the assist based on signals received from vehicle speed sensors. This sophisticated system provides improved maneuverability with maximum assist at low speeds, such as when parking– Decreases assist at highway speeds to provide improved road feel

Performs well in isolating the driver from the feedback of uneven road surfaces
Power Recirculating Ball-and-nut
Major design features include:– Linkage steering gear forward of the front wheel axis that combines with a lightweight steering pump for maximum assist when turning the wheel– Power assist for low-speed turning and parking
Stroke
Maximum distance traveled by a piston between bottom-dead-center (BDC) and top-dead-center (TDC). If the stroke is increased, the displacement increases and vice versa.
Strut
Suspension element that uses a reinforced shock absorber as one of the wheel’s locating members, typically by solidly connecting the wheel hub to the bottom of the strut.
Sub frame
Partial frame that connects the vehicle’s power train and front suspension or rear components to its underbody.
Sub frame, Isolated
Attaches to the front or rear structure of some Ford vehicles
Provides support for the engine, transmission and often the suspension
Provides added strength and rigidity to the vehicle’s construction
Uses rubber mounts to reduce levels of noise, vibration and harshness
Supercharger
Supercharger is a large air pump that is normally mounted on the engine intake manifold and belt-driven by the crankshaft
Most superchargers contain two impellers that compress the incoming air charge
Advantage of compressing the intake air is that you allow more air to enter each cylinder. The engine’s fuel control computer then adds more fuel to compensate for the added air, increasing the power and torque output of the engine
Typical boost provided by a supercharger is 6 to 8 pounds per square inch (psi)
Suspension Systems - Front

Suspension Systems - Rear
Air Suspension
F-650/F-750 Chassis Cabs
Air suspension system replaces the leaf springs or coil springs with reinforced rubber airbags or bladders
Airbags are located between the frame and axle and provide the weight-carrying capacity of the rear axle
Air spring suspensions provide a smoother, more compliant ride than typical leaf spring suspensions
Multi-link
Taurus and Taurus X use an independent design that is mounted on U-shaped sub frame. Upper and lower control arms with gas-pressurized shock absorbers mounted in a coil-over-shock design. Stabilizer bar reduces body lean while cornering
Fusion and the Edge use an independent design that is mounted to a sub frame and works like a double-wishbone setup. Twist-blade control arms with gas-pressurized shock absorbers, coil springs and a stabilizer bar

Synchromesh
Synchromesh clutch is typically a drum or sleeve that slides back and forth on a splined output shaft by means of a shifting fork
Generally, it has a bronze cone on each side that engages with a tapered mating cone. When this drum, or sleeve, is moved along the output shaft, the cone acts as a clutch
Upon contacting the gear that is to be engaged, the output shaft is sped up or slowed down as required until the speeds of the output shaft and the gear are synchronized, or are “in sync” with each other
Synchronized Gears
Synchronized gears are used in manual transmissions to facilitate the meshing of two gears by causing the speed of both gears to coincide
This helps move clutch assemblies to the specific chosen gear
A synchronizer will help prevent an improper shift that could damage the transmission, such as shifting into first gear at highway speeds

Tachometer
Gauge on the vehicle instrument cluster indicating engine speed measured in crankshaft revolutions per minute (rpm).
Tailgate Step
An integrated steel step and handle that folds down from the top of an open tailgate
Allows an easier step up into the cargo box and stores itself once the tailgate is closed
Tappets, Hydraulic Roller Valve
Also known as valve lifters
A device in the valve system that transmits the action of the cam to the valve or the push rod
Hydraulic lifters are designed to automatically take up the clearance that exists between the valve and the lifter
This is known as valve lash
Theater-style Seating
Also known as “stadium seating”
Second- and/or third-row seats are raised slightly higher than the preceding seats in front, similar to seats found in a movie theater or stadium
Allows rear-seat passengers to have a better view of the road through the windshield
Three-valves-per-cylinder Engine Design
Power train design that usually uses two intake valves and one exhaust valve per cylinder. The improved flow of air/ fuel into and out of the engine improves operation virtually to the level of a four-valve-per-cylinder design but with somewhat less complexity and cost.
Throttle Body
Housing containing a valve to regulate the airflow through the intake manifold and usually located between the air cleaner and the intake manifold.
Tire Information
Most Ford car and light truck tires carry a P-metric designation such as P185/70R14 or an LT-metric designation such as LT235/70R16. In the charts below, the alphabetical or metric and load range letters used are obtained from Tire and Rim Association Standard Tables. P-metric Steel-belted Radial-ply Tires All Ford cars and most light trucks have P-metric steel-belted radial-ply tires as standard equipment. They are designed in accordance with nationally accepted dimensional standards. Benefits include:
Improved fuel economy through increased inflation pressure (up to 35 psi; 44 psi for some light trucks)
Lighter weight
Tread compounds designed for reduced rolling resistance LT-metric Steel-belted Radial Tires
LT-metric designates a light truck radial tire with a metric tire designation
Available with both all-season and all-terrain tread patterns for greater versatility
Designed to support larger vehicles and heavier loads Medium-Duty Truck Tires used on Ford medium-duty trucks (F-650/F-750 and Ford LCF) are of a radial-ply design. They fall into several classes of service conditions:
Over-the-road (highway) tires are used on paved surfaces for local and/or long distance runs
Mixed service tires are for use on a variety of surfaces such as pavement, gravel, dirt or other unpaved surfaces
All-position tires have treads that are suitable for general over-the-road operation
Steering axle tires usually feature circumferential grooves that equalize pressure across the tread face
Drive axle tires have deep treads and block-type patterns for extra traction All-season Tires Most Ford vehicles use all-season tires with a wraparound block-type tread design that offers the following benefits:
Increased traction in mud and snow
May be used year-round as standard passenger car or light truck tires Tread compounds and tire construction used with the all-season tires are formulated to convert less energy to heat when flexing compared to previous compounds. This helps reduce rolling resistance compared to previously designed steel-belted radial-ply tires. All-terrain Tires
All-terrain tires are available on several light trucks, primarily on 4x4 models. As their name indicates, all-terrain tires are designed for both on- and off-road use over a variety of surfaces
Generally, they have a deeper, wider tread design than all-season tires for better gripping on a variety of surfaces Aspect Ratio
Measurement of a tire’s unloaded sidewall height divided by its width
As an example, a tire with an aspect ratio of 75 would have a section height that is 75 percent of the tire's width
Lower aspect ratio reflects a shorter, wider tire that offers greater contact with the road. Dual Spacing Distance between the center lines of both tires on a dual-rear setup. Flotation Tires
Tires with an extra-wide tread width are often referred to as flotation tires
Usual applications are for off-road operation where soft sand, mud, marshy or snowy conditions are typical Offset
On dual wheels, the distance from the center of the rim midway between the flanges to the outer mounting face of the wheel
On single wheels, this is the distance from the center of the rim to the wheel mounting surface Performance Tires, All-season
Performance tires generally have aggressive tread designs and are distinguished by large, solid tread blocks separated by open channels to promote water drainage and prevent hydroplaning
A key benefit of performance tires is optimized steering response and adhesion during acceleration, braking and cornering, usually with some small penalty in ride harshness and tread noise Ply Rating (PR), Load Range (B), Load Index/Speed Designation (97V) or Standard Load Rating (SL or XL)
Ply rating is a standard unit of tire casing strength, based on the strength of cord plies
The term is used to indicate the load-carrying ability of a given tire
It is an index of tire strength and does not necessarily represent the number of cord plies in the tire
Ply rating is indicated as 4PR, 6PR, 8PR, etc.
Load range (B, C, D, etc.) is gradually replacing the term "ply rating"
Load index/speed designation (92T, 97H, 97V, etc.)
P-metric passenger-type tires are offered with a standard load rating (SL — up to 35 psi) or extra load rating(XL — up to 41 psi)Radial-Ply Tires Type of tire that has one or more rubberized plies of cords running from bead to bead at right angles to the tread and parallel to each other, plus two or more plies of reinforced belts that encircle the tire under the tread. Rim Width Distance between the inside surfaces of the rim flanges. Speed Designations Tires are laboratory wheel-tested at specified load and inflation pressure for the speed designation. R-rated tires are specified for speeds up to and including 106 mph S-rated tires are specified for speeds up to and including 112 mph T-rated tires are specified for speeds up to and including 118 mph H-rated tires are specified for speeds up to and including 130 mph V-rated tires are specified for speeds up to and including 149 mph Z-rated tires are specified for speeds over 149 mph NOTE: Speed designations are for reference only. Actual speed capability of tires may change in vehicle applications. Tire Clearance to Vehicle Distance between the tire sidewall or tread and the nearest part of the vehicle's chassis, suspension or body. Tire Loaded Radius
Distance from the center of the wheel to the road with tire loaded to rated capacity
Static radius applied when vehicle is at rest Tire Revolutions per Mile Term used for the number of times the tire revolves when traveling one mile. Tire Section Width Maximum outer width of an inflated new tire from sidewall to sidewall, exclusive of ribs, bars, decorations, etc. Track Width Lateral distance between the centers of the front or rear tires. Unidirectional Tires Tread pattern designed for rotation in the direction indicated on the sidewall and used in some performance tire designs, e.g., Goodyear Eagle VR60 tires.
Tire Pressure Monitoring System (TPMS)
TPMS uses a tire pressure sensor mounted to a metal band in the wheel’s drop well
Sensors use radio frequency transmitters to send tire pressure information to the vehicle’s onboard computer
The computer illuminates a warning light and sounds an audible tone when tire pressure is significantly low
System is completely hidden from sight and uses a standard rubber valve stem
Can be used on steel or aluminum wheels
Replacing the tire can be easily done without removing the sensor
TPMS provides a more accurate tire pressure reading because it measures actual tire pressure as opposed to wheel speed like the Low Tire Warning System
Senses temperature-based pressure loss where all four wheels are affected
Resetting the system is easy. Once cold tire pressure has been restored to its recommended level, TPMS-equipped vehicles simply need to be driven over 20 mph for at least 2 minutes to be reset
Torque
Turning or twisting force that produces rotation, expressed in pound-feet (lb.-ft.)
Torque affects the vehicle’s performance when accelerating, when carrying heavy loads or when towing a trailer
See Torque Rating How torque is generated in one cylinder of a four-stroke engine
Combustion of gas in the cylinder creates pressure against the piston
That pressure creates a force on the piston that pushes it down
The force is transmitted from the piston to the connecting rod, and from the connecting rod to the crankshaft
The point where the connecting rod attaches to the crankshaft is some distance from the center of the shaft
The horizontal distance changes as the crankshaft spins, so the torque also changes since torque equals force multiplied by distance
Torque Converter
Device in an automatic transmission/transaxle that transforms mechanical power (torque) from the engine into hydro kinetic (fluid) power to the transmission.
Torque converter serves as a hydraulic clutch
Engine is mechanically linked to an impeller, which is made up of a series of blades within a housing filled with transmission fluid
Impeller responds directly to engine speed, which transfers energy to the fluid
Turbine, which consists of a separate series of blades, absorbs this fluidic energy and transmits power to the transmission
This mechanism allows for a smooth transfer of power from the engine to the transmission
Torque Rating
Measure of an engine's power capability whereby the amount of twisting or rotating effort being exerted on the crankshaft is expressed in pound-feet (lb.-ft.) of force. The unit "pound-foot" represents the force of one pound acting at a right angle to the rotating crankshaft at a distance of one foot in length. Torque is what gets the vehicle moving and horsepower is what keeps the vehicle moving.
Torque Steer
Unwanted imbalance of driving force between the front wheels of a front-wheel-drive vehicle that causes the car to pull to the left or right under heavy acceleration
Driver senses torque steer as a turning force at the steering wheel when the vehicle is accelerating from a start. Under normal driving conditions, torque steer is virtually eliminated in Ford vehicles
Torsion Bar
Spring consisting of a long solid or tubular rod with one end fixed to the chassis and the other twisted by a lever connected to the suspension.
Traction Control — All-Speed
All-Speed Traction Control uses a combination of brake and/or engine control to maximize available traction on slippery or loose driving surfaces.
Traction-Lock (Limited-slip)
Rear-wheel-drive mechanical system that operates within the differential. Traction-Lock provides added traction on slippery surfaces, particularly when one rear drive wheel has poor traction. Limited-slip is not offered on front-wheel-drive vehicles.
Tractor Brake Control Valve
Mechanism added to a tractor or trailer brake system that safeguards the air supply on the towing unit and automatically applies the brakes on the trailer if it accidentally becomes separated.
Trailer Hitch
There are two types of trailer hitches:
Trailer Sway Control
Works in conjunction with the AdvanceTrac® or AdvanceTrac® with RSC® (Roll Stability Control TM) system to help maintain vehicle/trailer stability while towing a trailer
Measures the yaw motion of a vehicle and applies brake force to individual wheels, and if necessary, reduces engine power to help the driver regain control of the vehicle/trailer
If equipped with the Integrated Trailer Brake Controller, the trailer brakes will also be activated to reduce the sway condition and help the driver regain control of the vehicle/trailer
Trailer Tongue Load
Weight in pounds that a trailer (loaded or unloaded) exerts directly on the hitch ball attached to the towing vehicle. This load is considered in maintaining the loading limits of the vehicle.
Trailing Arm
Suspension element that consists of a longitudinal member that pivots from the body at its forward end and has a wheel hub rigidly attached to its trailing end. Similar to a semi-trailing arm, except that its pivot axis is perpendicular to the car's longitudinal center.
Trailing Link
Suspension link mounted ahead of a wheel and aligned to resist longitudinal motions in the wheel.
Transfer Case
An auxiliary device on a four-wheel-drive vehicle that allows power to be delivered to front and rear differentials.
Transmission/Transaxle
Transaxle
Power-transmission device, attached to one end of the engine, combining the functions of the transmission and the drive axle (final drive and differential) into a single assembly
Typically used on front-wheel-drive applications Transmission
Metal case containing an assembly of shafts, gears and related parts used to transmit power from the engine to the drive shaft or final drive of an automotive vehicle; provides different gear ratios as well as Neutral and Reverse. May be manual, automatic or continuously variable. Typically used on rear-wheel-drive applications Manual Transmission/Transaxle
System in which gears are selected by the driver by means of a hand-operated gearshift lever and afoot-operated clutch
Manual transmissions are typically 5-speed, but high-performance vehicles often use a 6-speed manual Automatic Transmission/Transaxle
Automatic transmissions have hydraulically operated gear sets that require no gear shifting or clutching by the driver
Gears are shifted automatically through the use of hydraulics and electric signals from an on-board computer
A series of gears are applied as the need arises. This need is determined by vehicle weight, load and demand placed upon the performance system
Automatic transmissions come in 4, 5 and 6 speeds. The highest gear is for overdrive Electronically Controlled Continuously Variable Transmission (eCVT)
Used exclusively in the Escape Hybrid
Uses an electronically controlled planetary gear set that includes the traction motor and power management electronics in one compact assembly
Planetary gear set can vary the distribution of power between the gasoline engine and the electric drive system or both, depending on driving conditions
There are no defined gear "steps" as in a conventional transmission
The planetary gear set allows the gasoline engine to operate at its most efficient or powerful engine speed relative to the vehicle's speed. This contributes to efficiency and performance
Transverse-mounted Engine
Power train layout design in which the engine crankshaft centerline is aligned parallel to the drive axle (s)
Engine is mounted sideways in the engine compartment, usually allowing additional interior room
Tuned Intake/Exhaust Systems
Intake and/or exhaust systems that harness the pressure pulses and resonances inside various passages and chambers in the intake and exhaust manifolds to increase the flow of the intake charge into and out of the combustion chambers.
Turbocharger
A supercharger that is driven by a turbine turned by exhaust gases from the engine.
Turning Diameter
Combination of the proper front axle equipment results in an important performance specification. The turning diameter will be of significance to the individual owner as well as the fleet operator. The turning diameter is defined as the diameter of the outside track made by the outside front tire during the shortest turn. The diagram shows the diameter made by the outside edge of the bumper during the shortest turn. Note: When comparing competitive truck specifications, note whether they spec a diameter or radius dimension.

Diesel fuel with a maximum sulphur content of 15 parts per million (ppm).
The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has mandated this fuel must be used in new model year 2008diesel engines
This mandate does not apply to carryover engines like the 6.0L Power Stroke® V8 turbo diesel currently in use in many Ford E-Series trucks
Understeer/Oversteer
Under steer is a condition that occurs when a vehicle turns at a smaller angle than the steering wheel input because of front tire slippage. When this occurs, the steering wheel must be turned at a greater angle to achieve the desired turn. Under steer will be affected by the amount of wheel turn lock-to-lock as well as the vehicle's weight and the speed of the vehicle when encountering turns
Over steer occurs when the vehicle turns more than steering wheel input and is indicated by rear tire slippage. It can make the vehicle hard to control. Because of this, engineers often design suspensions that tend toward under steer as a safety measure
Unitized Body Construction (Unibody)
With unitized body construction, the front, rear and side rails are welded together with the floor pan, cross members and torque boxes to form a single "unit," whereas body-on-frame construction has two pieces, the body and the frame
Commonly used for car and mini van construction in which a solid robust frame is not required
Provides an advantage of less vehicle weight that helps contribute to performance and fuel economy
Unsprung Weight
Components such as tires, wheels and brakes are not supported by the suspension and are considered unsprung weight
Reducing unsprung weight improves ride and handling by allowing the tires to respond more rapidly to road irregularities
Independent rear suspension reduces unsprung weight by attaching the differential to the chassis rather than solidly mounting it with the axle
V

Variable Cam Timing
Variable camshaft timing allows the valves to be operated at different points in the combustion cycle, to provide performance that is precisely tailored to the engine’s specific speed and load at that instant
The power train control module (PCM) directs solenoids to alter the oil flow in the hydraulic cam timing mechanism, which rotates the camshafts in relation to their drive sprockets
The unit can shift between fully advanced and fully retarded in milliseconds
The result is enhanced efficiency under low-load conditions, such as at idle or highway cruising, and increased power for brisk acceleration or times of high demand
Variable valve timing reduces pumping losses, the work required to pull air in and push exhaust out of the cylinder
Variable-rate Coil Spring
A coil spring operating with a variable number of active coils
Under load, some of the coils will come in contact with one another, thereby becoming inactive– Process is controlled by the wire diameter of each coil, which is continuously variable for approximately one-third the total number of coils– Increases the stiffness of the spring in proportion to the load
VIN
Abbreviation for Vehicle Identification Number
Refer to esourcebook.dealerconnection.com for specific information
Viscous Coupling
Fluid coupling in which the input and output shafts mate with thin, alternately spaced discs in a cylindrical chamber filled with a viscous fluid that clings to the discs, thereby causing them to resist the speed differences between the two shafts
Used to limit the speed differences between two inputs on a differential or between two axles on a vehicle

Weight Definitions — Actual Weights
Curb Weight
Weight of the vehicle including standard equipment, oil, lubricants and a full tank of fuel. Does not include optional contents or other optional equipment, the weight of driver, passengers or cargo Option Weight
Weight of any added equipment not included in the base curb weight Passenger Weight
Defined as 150 lbs. multiplied by the number of seating positions, including the driver, that the vehicle can carry Payload
Gross payload is defined as the weight of all passengers, options and cargo
Net payload is defined as the weight that can be placed in the truck after subtracting for passenger and optional equipment Gross Vehicle Weight (GVW)
Weight of the vehicle including passengers, options and all cargo Trailer Weight
Weight of a trailer including all attachments, lights, etc. Gross Combination Weight (GCW)
Gross Vehicle Weight plus the trailer weight Gross Axle Weight
Weight loaded on the front or rear axle Tongue Weight
Amount of the trailer’s weight that presses down on the trailer hitch (usually 10–15 percent of the trailer’s weight ,approximately 25 percent for fifth-wheel applications)
Weight Distribution
Portion of a vehicle’s total weight that will be supported by each axle and each tire. Proper distribution of vehicle weight is critical to braking, handling and to the service life of components such as axles, springs, bearings and tires.
Weight Ratings
Weight ratings are not actual weights, they are ratings that must be adhered to when the vehicle is in use. Payload Rating
Advertised payload rating. It is the maximum allowable payload for the truck Allowable Weight
Maximum amount of weight that can be placed in the vehicle after subtracting allowances for passenger sand options Gross Vehicle Weight Rating (GVWR)
Maximum allowable weight of the loaded vehicle with payload Gross Axle Weight Rating (GAWR)
Maximum allowable weight to be placed on an individual axle. Gross Axle Weight Ratings are provided for both front and rear axles Gross Combination Weight Rating (GCWR)
Maximum allowable weight of the vehicle, its trailer and all associated passengers, cargo and equipment NOTE: Actual weights should never exceed the listed weight ratings. Remind customers that exceeding the recommended weight ratings could disqualify their warranty coverage.
Weight-carrying (Non-weight-distributing) Hitch
Commonly used to tow small- and medium-size trailers
Weight-distributing Receiver Hitch
Used in conjunction with a hitch platform (receiver), distributes tongue weight to all towing vehicle and trailer wheels
Required for certain Class III and all Class IV applications
Weight-distributing hitch platforms are welded or bolted to the vehicle frame. Bolt-on types are recommended because they can be removed
Properly installed bolt-on weight-distributing hitch platform will not weaken the vehicle or underbody as heat from welding might
Equalizing arms are connected from the hitch to the trailer’s A-frame and are adjusted for best towing performance. Lengths of chain are pulled up and tightened to bend spring bars upward, which lifts some of the weight from the rear wheels and transfers weight to the other wheels of the vehicle and trailer
Wheelbase
Distance between the center points of the front and rear wheels.
Y
Print
Yaw
Vehicle’s rotation about its vertical axis. Excessive yaw rate is often referred to as fishtailing.
Yield Strength
Maximum amount of stress in pounds per square inch to which a frame may be subjected through loading and return to its original shape upon removal of the stress with no deformation.

You may be able to configure a Ford Mustang Mach-E vehicle (the “Vehicle”) through the Reservation Process (“Reservation”).  By completing the Reservation Process, you are not ordering or purchasing a vehicle.  The Reservation Process allows you to configure a Vehicle and pay the Reservation Deposit (“Reservation Deposit”) to Ford.  Participation in the Program does not guarantee you vehicle delivery. You must contact a Dealer to discuss final transaction pricing, arrange any necessary financing, and complete your purchase of the Vehicle.  Your Reservation does not guarantee a set price for the Vehicle. The Dealer sets the Vehicle price, which may differ from the MSRP. Unless otherwise indicated, MSRP is the manufacturer suggested retail price and does not include destination/delivery fee plus government fees and taxes, any finance charges, any dealer processing charge, any electronic filing charge, and any emission testing charge. Optional equipment not included.

2. Sharing of Reservation Information.
You will be required to select a dealer at the time of Reservation. Your information including name, address, e-mail address and Vehicle configuration will be shared with the dealer you select. Your credit card information will not be shared.

3. Reservation Process.
In order to complete the Reservation Process, you will be required to (1) create and/or login to your Ford account, (2) submit certain information to Ford, and (3) pay a refundable Reservation Deposit of $500 to Ford.  Ford will hold Reservation Deposits and will not pay interest on Reservation Deposits. Any interest earned on the account will be the sole property of Ford.

4. Vehicle Specifications, Configuration and Battery Range.
You understand that we may not have completed the development of the Vehicle or begun manufacturing the Vehicle at the time of your Reservation. By agreeing to these Terms, you represent and warrant to us that you understand that the Vehicle configuration may change prior to execution of a sales agreement between you and a Dealer.

5. No Purchase Requirement.
The Program does not require you to complete a vehicle purchase, finance, or lease contract. If you change your mind before you have entered into a contract with your Dealer, you may cancel your Reservation pursuant to Section 10 below.

6. Right to Decline, Cancel Reservation.
Ford, at its sole discretion, may decline or cancel your Reservation at any time, for any reason. You will be notified by email if your Reservation is declined, and your Reservation Deposit will be refunded if it has already been processed.

7. Right to Modify, Cancel Program.
Ford reserves the right to change, update, improve, correct, modify, suspend, discontinue or cancel all or part of the Program, including any of its features, functionalities or manners of operation at any time without any notice or obligation to you. Your use of the Program after any changes are implemented will be considered acceptance of such changes.  The Program may not be available during maintenance breaks and other times.

8. Reservation Eligibility: Age and Residency; Entity Reservations.
You must be at least 18 years of age or the age of majority as determined by the laws of your state or territory of residency and a resident of the United States in order to accept these Terms and to participate in the Program. The Program is only open to individuals; companies, groups and organizations are not eligible to participate.  Reservations are limited to two per Ford account. Ford may cancel your Reservation and refund the Reservation Deposit if Ford determines that you are an ineligible party.

9. Registration; No Brokers.
In order to participate in the Program, you will be required to provide certain information, such as your address and billing information. You represent and warrant that all such information is accurate, and you shall ensure that such information is kept current. Ford shall have no responsibility or liability for inaccurate information or information that later becomes outdated, and shall have no obligation to make efforts to determine the correct contact or shipping information. You can update your information at any time by logging into your Ford Owner Account or FordPass account.  You represent and warrant that you are not a broker and that your registration and participation in the Program is for your own benefit on your own behalf. We may cancel your Reservation in the event we determine you have engaged in brokering.

10. Reservation Cancellation; Transfer; Assignment.
You may cancel your Reservation and request a refund online at owner.ford.com. If you cancel your Reservation before you order your vehicle, the full Reservation Deposit will be credited back to your credit card within 10 business days. Please note that all cancellations are final. You may not transfer or assign your Reservation or any other rights under these Terms and Conditions.

11. Force Majeure.
Your participation in the Program and/or your Reservation does not create liability for Ford or you for any failure to perform due to an event beyond our control, including, but not limited to, any Act of God, terrorism, war, political insurgence, insurrection, riot, civil unrest, act of civil or military authority, uprising, unavailability of materials, strike, earthquake, flood or any other natural or man-made eventuality outside of our control.


12. Entire Agreement, Modification and Severability.
We reserve the right, at our discretion, to change these Terms at any time. If for any reason a court of competent jurisdiction finds any provision, or portion thereof, to be unenforceable, the remainder of these Terms shall continue in full force and effect and the unenforceable provision shall be deemed to be modified solely to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. This Agreement represents the entire agreement governing your Reservation.

13. Limitation of Liability.
UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES WHATSOEVER, SUBJECT ONLY TO THE LIMITS OF APPLICABLE LAW, SHALL FORD BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR ANY DIRECT, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, INDIRECT, OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES OF ANY KIND WHATSOEVER, INCLUDING LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF BUSINESS OR LOSS OF OPPORTUNITY, REGARDLESS OF THE BASIS OR CIRCUMSTANCES OF ANY CLAIM, DAMAGE, LOSS OR EXPENSE, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE, AND REGARDLESS OF WHETHER WE HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF ANY CLAIMS, DAMAGES, LOSSES OR EXPENSES.

IN THE EVENT THAT WE ARE HELD LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIMS, DAMAGES, COSTS OR EXPENSES UNDER, ARISING OUT OF, OR WITH RESPECT TO THESE TERMS OR YOUR RESERVATION, OUR LIABILITY SHALL NOT EXCEED, IN THE AGGREGATE, THE AMOUNT OF YOUR RESERVATION DEPOSIT.

14. Applicable Law, Venue, and Class Action Waiver.
These Terms, its subject matter and its formation, and any related non-contractual disputes or claims, are governed by the laws of the State of Michigan. Ford and you agree that the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan, or the Sixth Circuit Court, Oakland County, Michigan has exclusive jurisdiction to settle any dispute, controversy or claim arising from or connected with these Terms. Ford and you consent to the jurisdiction of the Michigan courts and waive any objections as to personal jurisdiction or as to the laying of venue in such courts due to inconvenient forum or any other basis.

IN ADDITION, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, NO CLAIM UNDER THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE JOINED TO ANY OTHER CLAIM FROM OTHER CURRENT OR FORMER USERS OF THE SITE OR OTHERWISE RELATED TO THE VEHICLES OR ANY OTHER RESERVATIONS. NO CLAIM BROUGHT UNDER THIS AGREEMENT SHALL PROCEED AS A CLASS ACTION.

FURTHER, YOU HEREBY WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THESE TERMS, WHETHER NOW EXISTING OR HEREAFTER ARISING, AND WHETHER SOUNDING IN CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE. YOU AGREE THAT WE MAY FILE A COPY OF THIS PARAGRAPH WITH ANY COURT AS WRITTEN EVIDENCE OF THE KNOWING, VOLUNTARY AND BARGAINED-FOR AGREEMENT AMONG US TO IRREVOCABLY WAIVE TRIAL BY JURY AND THAT ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING WHATSOEVER BETWEEN US RELATING TO THESE TERMS SHALL INSTEAD BE TRIED IN A COURT OF COMPETENT JURISDICTION BY A JUDGE SITTING WITHOUT A JURY.

Innovation at The Factory
The Factory is an innovative, flexible workspace for Ford Motor Company. The historic 45,000-square-foot building was redesigned to foster collaboration; with flexible furniture, meeting spaces, and interactive screens, teams can customize their workspace to make teamwork easy. Designers focused on restoring the building's historic character, refurbishing the original timber beams and floors, and maximizing the connection to the outdoors through outdoor amenity spaces and floor-to-ceiling garage doors that bring in natural lighting.

Located in Detroit's historic Corktown neighborhood, the site reflects Ford's continued commitment to reviving the community. The urban setting allows the teams to immerse themselves in the lifestyle and mobility challenges of an urban environment that they're working to solve.
Michigan Central
The new Michigan Central Station celebrated its grand reopening on June 6, 2024. This former railroad station was one of the architectural gems of Detroit, and it’s now been restored to its full splendor. Today’s Michigan Central will bring collaboration, innovation and community together to create new technology and opportunities for Detroiters and Michiganders.

2025 F-150®
Off-Roading
Go Where No GPS Would Recommend
2025 F-150® off-road trucks are for the serious off-roader who considers a dirty truck a badge of honor, never backs down from a challenge, and leaves no terrain unexplored. With exceptional 4-wheeling capability, rugged off-road technology, and powerful engines underhood, you can drive deeper into the desert or into the thick of things where only the bold venture.
Professional driver on a closed course. Always consult your Owner’s Manual before off-road driving, know your terrain and trail difficulty, and use appropriate safety gear.
Selectable Drive Modes
As fast as the terrain or weather conditions change, you can quickly adapt with the twist of a dial. From mild to extreme, selectable drive modes help keep you in control wherever your day takes you.
Drive Modes
You won’t be caught off guard when the weather and road conditions take a turn with up to 9 available drive modes including: Normal, Slippery, Sport, Tow/Haul, Off-Road, Rock Crawl and Baja mode to handle just about any terrain you encounter.
Preys on Sand, Rocks, and Cacti
Raptor®
Give it room to roam and the Ford Raptor will show you what it's meant to do. Powerful performance and commanding capability accompanied by signature accents proves that it's more than ready to tackle desert sand.
Always consult the Raptor® supplement to the Owner’s Manual before off-road driving, know your terrain and trail difficulty, and use appropriate safety gear.
Raptor R™
This isn’t a truck for the meek. A white-knuckled 720 horsepower supercharged V8 matched with outstanding off-road durability, massive all-terrain tires and FOX® Racing Dual-Valve Live shock technology work as one making the F-150® Raptor R™ the ultimate purpose-built desert prowler.
Always consult the Raptor supplement to the Owner’s Manual before off-road driving, know your terrain and trail difficulty, and use appropriate safety gear.

F-150® TREMOR®
A stylish coast-to-coast grille leads the charge while unique badging and accents inside and out demand attention. Advanced selectable drive modes help provide a firm grip in unstable situations. Rugged off-road-tuned suspension increases ground clearance while absorbing the shock of every bump, dip, and rock along the route. Steel skid plates and large all-terrain tires help instill confidence over any landscape.
Always determine the water depth before attempting a crossing and proceed slowly. Refer to your Owner’s Manual for detailed information regarding driving through water.
Commanding Confidence
The 2025 TREMOR® pickup's powerful stance is commanding. Beefy treads underfoot grip and grab the ground for firm traction wherever you trudge. An available modular front bumper can be equipped with a power winch, brush bar and light bar.
Build Your TREMOR®
Beat The Unbeaten Path in FX4®
Cutting a path over dry cracked earth, washed out river beds and tangled brush isn't limited to TREMOR® and Raptor® trucks. Equipped with an assortment of durable features to take it off-road, the FX4 Package is set to take you far from the concrete jungle. Opt for the FX4 Package® on STX (201A), XLT, LARIAT®, King Ranch®, and Platinum® models.
Off-Road Ready
Stable footing comes courtesy of specially tuned off-road front shock absorbers and strengthened monotube rear shocks. Suppressing jarring impacts on its 18-inch all-terrain tires.

Flex Buy
Flex Buy is a Ford Credit-exclusive payment structure focused on providing lower payments for the first three years when compared with a standard retail contract.
Financing That Fits Your Budget
Flex Buy is like traditional retail financing where the interest rate doesn’t change and you own the vehicle. What makes Flex Buy different is the unequal payment structure. It starts with a lower payment for the first 36 months, then the payment increases at month 37 so that the balance is paid in full by the end of the contract term. Flex Buy is offered with 66- or 75-month terms.
  The Benefits
Lower payments for the first three years
Build equity with every payment and trade when you're ready
No surprises with a fixed interest rate
Freedom to customize your vehicle
Multiple term and payment discount options to fit your needs
  Flex Buy is unavailable in Maine, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Washington, D.C.

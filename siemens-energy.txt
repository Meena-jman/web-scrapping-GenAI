Green hydrogen production
Electrolyzer for green hydrogen production in detail
Decarbonizing through green hydrogen
Green hydrogen (H2) is a versatile energy carrier that can be applied to decarbonize a wide range of sectors. It can be used directly or in the form of its derivatives like e-Methanol, e-Ammonia, or e-Fuels to replace fossil fuels like coal or gas.
Only around 40% of global carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions originate from power generation which can be decarbonized via electrification. The other 60% of CO2 emissions originate from industry, mobility, buildings and others. These can be decarbonized via sector coupling, using green hydrogen and its derivatives to make renewable energy available to those sectors. This is why the production of sustainable hydrogen is so important for the energy transition.

Brownfield transformation: Repowering power plants
Get on the road to a decarbonized future by converting your brownfield power plant
* Above figures are estimates
Today increasingly ambitious CO₂ targets are being set around the world. Reaching them won’t come about by itself. Apart from intelligent energy management and improved energy efficiency, we need to decarbonize power generation for utilities and industry. And since we can’t rebuild energy generation from scratch, assets viewed as burdensome today, such as coal power plants, must be repurposed as bridges to a new energy future.  Converting existing power plants, so they help us reach the decarbonized economy we all aim for.

Driving a resilient future: key energy transition strategies
Five energy transition strategies we’re taking to transform the energy system.
The energy transition promises to herald in a future where electricity becomes the core of our energy systems and huge leaps in clean energy innovation further drive down the prices of renewable energy and create a rapid shift away from coal and oil toward an economy powered by carbon-neutral, hydrogen-based fuels. Yet today, energy is still responsible for more than 70 percent of emissions, and the climate crisis is already affecting every region of the planet, leaving aging energy systems vulnerable to strain and disruption. More than ever, the world needs a new energy era, one resilient enough to recover quickly from shocks and support the global economy.
As climate change accelerates and the urgency to reduce greenhouse gas emissions grows, governments, businesses, and individuals worldwide increasingly recognize the need to adopt energy transition strategies that promote both environmental sustainability and economic resilience. But time is of the essence. 2024 was the hottest recorded year on earth and the first to pass the 1.5°C warming limit. 
To avoid the worst impacts of climate change, we need to act now with five strategies to drive the energy transition:

Driving the energy transition
Discover strategies, solutions, and technologies to move the energy transition forward
The energy transition is one of the most pressing global challenges of our time. It requires the shift towards more sustainable low carbon alternatives to limit earth’s warming to below 2º C. However, at 37.7 billion metric tons, global energy related CO2 emissions reached a new record in 2023. Current policies predict global CO2 emissions will peak soon, but without a significant decline, we’re on track for a 2.4º C temperature rise by the end of the century.
Embracing the energy transition for a sustainable, zero-carbon world
The energy transition is our main tool to lower emissions. It is a gradual and steady move away from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources and a zero-carbon energy system. There is no one single solution to get us there. Instead, different regions face different challenges shaped by policies, energy infrastructure and resources, as well as by returns on investment and the life of their current assets. As an energy technology company, we shape the path to a sustainable energy system with innovative collaborations for new technologies and strategies. It’s time for partners across the whole energy landscape to put them into action.

Renewable energy
We support our customers in delivering the energy transition with our sustainable solutions for a greener and cleaner world, using renewable energy sources including sun, wind, water and biomass
Renewable energy: Harness the power of the future
Utilize the potential of the sun, wind, water and more
Renewable sources including solar, wind, hydropower and biofuels are vital in the transition towards less carbon-intensive energy systems. And while the generation of electricity from the sun and wind has grown rapidly in recent years, further expansion is urgently needed to keep the 1.5°C climate target within reach. According to the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), an average of 1,000GW of renewable energy capacity needs to be added every year until 2030.
Much more needs to be done across the value chain: making the grid more robust, increasing storage and using more green hydrogen and derivatives in high-emission industries such as transportation. We work every day to supply our partners with the technologies they need to effect these changes.

Gas-fired power plants fuel the energy transition
Gas-fired power plants can deliver a fast path to low-carbon energy systems today – plus, they can be fully decarbonized
The energy demand is rising. Growing economies, electrification and digitalization are driving the need for more power. At the same time, however, the world needs to respond to climate change. While renewable energy is increasing worldwide, there are still challenges in ensuring affordable, reliable, and sustainable power around the clock. This is where gas-fired power plants, usually operated as natural gas power plants, come in as a key energy transition strategy. 
Already today, gas-fired power plants generate 23 percent of the world’s electricity, providing essential services for the energy transition. They help replace coal and oil power, with new gas-fired power plants reducing CO2 emissions by up to 65 percent compared to existing coal plants and up to 60 percent compared to oil plants. Whether as peaker plants operating when there is high demand or as that add a steam turbine to generate up to 50 percent more electricity, gas-fired power plants step in on days with little or no sun or wind, producing much-needed residual load. They also stabilize the grid with their rotating masses, bringing ancillary services and resilience to the grid while supporting the expansion of solar and wind power. Moreover, gas-fired power plants can be fully decarbonized using sustainable fuels like hydrogen or carbon capture, utilization and storage (CCUS). In short, don’t just build a bridge to a decarbonized future – they are part of it. 
The replacement of a coal-fired plant with a gas-fired combined cycle power plant leads to a reduction of CO2 emissions by 65%

Heat Pump interactive PDF
Industrial heat pumps are an efficient and cost-effective solution for the generation of heat and cold. They lift the temperature by absorbing thermal energy from an existing low-temperature heat source and releasing it to a warmer space. The use of a heat source (e.g., waste heat from industries or renewable heat from nature, like rivers or geothermal sources) enables heat pumps to generate much more heat with a certain amount of electricity, than a simple direct conversion of electric power to heat could do.

Shaping a new energy world with storage solutions
To fight climate change we need carbon neutral energy production and distribution.
Shaping a new energy world with storage solutions
To fight climate change we need carbon neutral energy production and distribution.
  For that, renewables such as wind and solar are key. But their supply fluctuates – and still, energy demand has to be met, and the grid has to operate reliably and economically.
While today’s energy producers respond to grid fluctuations by mainly relying on fossil-fired power plants, energy storage solutions will take on a dominant role in fulfilling this need in the future, supplying renewable energy 24/7. It’s already taking shape today – and in the coming years it will become a more and more indispensable and flexible part of our new energy world.

Bringing Zero closer: Gas-insulated switchgear and busduct
With Zero F-gases and Zero harm, our Blue switchgear solutions make a greener grid achievable.
Why we need to go for Zero. And why you need Blue.
With the energy sector having a greater carbon impact than every other industry combined, the urgent need for decarbonization to combat climate change cannot be overstated. Renewable energy sources are only part of the solution; at Siemens Energy we understand how essential it is to achieve Zero Global Warming Potential (GWP) in the transmission of power as well as in its generation. Most switchgear still uses SF6 for insulation – a gas 24,300 times more climate-hostile than CO2 and one which stays in the atmosphere for up to 3,200 years. Even the new F-gas alternatives are still harmful to the environment when released. That’s not sustainable, as recognized by the new EU-F-gas-regulation. And it’s why we’ve developed our Zero-harm Blue portfolio, including gas-insulated switchgear and gas-insulated busduct. 
When traditional technology is still needed
While we are continuously striving for Zero, it is not yet possible for every voltage level. Thats why we still offer a range of high-performance traditional switchgear.

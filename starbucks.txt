For example, closed circuit video surveillance cameras (“CCTV”) may be installed at some of our retail locations to monitor building security and assist in crime prevention, detection, and investigation, and to ensure the safety of our staff and visitors to our facilities, and these CCTV cameras may collect audio, visual, and similar information.  Also, depending on your choices, we may collect audio information when you use voice ordering.

We may collect this location information or derive it from your GPS, WiFi, Bluetooth or other location-based technology for purposes of facilitating our services, such as to provide you with information about stores near you, to enable you to remotely order and pay for our products and services, or so that you may have certain Starbucks products delivered to you by a third-party vendor.

7. Cookies, Web Beacons, and Similar Technologies
We and others may use a variety of technologies to collect information about your device and use of our websites and mobile applications. These technologies include first- and third-party cookies, web beacons, JavaScript, entity tags, and HTML local storage. Most web browsers can be programmed to accept or reject the use of some or all of these technologies, although you must take additional steps to disable or control other technologies. For more information on exercising your preferences in relation to cookies and similar technologies, please see the section of this Notice titled “Your Choices & Rights”.
Cookies – Cookies are small data files that are sent from a website’s server and are stored on your device’s hard drive either for only the duration of your visit (“session cookies”) or for a fixed period (“persistent cookies”). Cookies contain information that can later be read by a web server.
You may be able to reject cookies, web beacons, entity tags and HTML5 local storage by adjusting the appropriate settings in your browser. Each browser is different, but many browsers have preferences or options that may be adjusted to allow you to either accept or reject cookies and certain other technologies before they are set or installed, or allow you to remove or reject the use or installation of certain technologies altogether. If you want to learn the correct way to modify your browser settings, please use the Help menu in your browser or review the instructions provided by the following browsers: Internet Explorer, Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Safari Desktop, Safari Mobile; and Android browser.
Interest-Based Ads – Many advertising companies that collect information for interest-based advertising are members of the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA) or the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI), both of which maintain websites where people can opt out of interest-based advertising from their members. To opt-out of website interest-based advertising provided by each organization’s respective participating companies, visit the DAA’s opt-out portal available at http://optout.aboutads.info/, the DAA of Canada’s opt-out portal available at https://youradchoices.ca/en/tools, or visit the NAI’s opt-out portal available at http://optout.networkadvertising.org/?c=1.
Residents of the European Union may opt-out of online behavioral advertising served by the European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance’s participating member organizations by visiting https://www.youronlinechoices.eu/.
To opt-out of data collection for interest-based advertising across mobile applications by participating companies, download the DAA’s App Choices mobile application opt-out offering at https://youradchoices.com/appchoices.
Adobe Flash Player Technology – We allow Adobe to set and enable special cookies that are necessary to deliver video content for Adobe Flash Player. You cannot remove Flash cookies simply by changing your browser settings. If you would like to limit the websites that can store information in Flash cookies on your device, you must visit the Adobe website:
http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager07.html
Web Beacons – Web beacons are small, transparent images that are embedded in web pages, applications, and emails that are sometimes called “clear gifs,” “single pixel gifs”, “page tags” or “web bugs.” We use web beacons to track the web pages you visit, to test the effectiveness of our marketing, and to find out if an email has been opened and acted on.
JavaScript – JavaScript are code snippets embedded in various parts of websites and applications that facilitate a variety of operations including accelerating the refresh speed of certain functionality or monitoring usage of various online components.
Entity Tags -- Entity Tags are HTTP code mechanisms that allow portions of websites to be stored or “cached” within your browser and validates these caches when the website is opened, accelerating website performance since the web server does not need to send a full response if the content has not changed.
HTML5 Local Storage – HTML5 local storage allows data from websites to be stored or “cached” within your browser to store and retrieve data in HTML5 pages when the website is revisited. These and similar technologies are used for the following purposes:
Services and Functionality – Some of these technologies are required to allow you to access and use our websites or mobile applications and the various services and functionality we offer. Without these technologies, some of the services and functionality on our websites and mobile applications would not work properly.
Performance Monitoring – Some of these technologies help us analyze and estimate traffic and assess the volume of use of services and functionality on websites and mobile applications. They show us how visitors and customers interact with our digital properties, whether there are any errors, the degree to which certain web pages, applications, services or functionality are accessed and used and how they are performing or operating. When these technologies are used for performance monitoring, no directly identifiable information (e.g., your name, email address or phone number) is collected.
User Convenience – Some of these technologies enhance the ease of use of our websites and mobile applications and the services and functionality they make available by accelerating load and refresh times and remembering information that you have provided on prior visits to our websites or when you last used a website or mobile application service or functionality.
Marketing – Some of these technologies are used to tailor your experience on our website, within our mobile applications, or across your applications or devices by controlling the promotions, advertisements and other marketing messages that may appear when you access or use these or other digital properties.
Taken together, these technologies help us learn which services and functionality you are using and how you are accessing information about us. We may use this information to personalize your visit to a website or use of a mobile application or to send you relevant promotions and advertisements.
8. How We Protect Your Information
Starbucks uses reasonable technical, physical, and administrative security measures to reduce the risk of loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure or modification of your information. However, no security system is perfect, and due to the inherent nature of the Internet, we cannot guarantee that data, including personal information, is absolutely safe from intrusion or other unauthorized access by others. You are responsible for protecting your password(s) and maintaining the security of your devices.
9. Retention
Starbucks stores information as reasonably necessary and proportionate to accomplish the purposes identified in this Notice based on criteria such as the length of time we need to provide the services to you, and to meet legal requirements, including record retention, resolving disputes, and enforcing our agreements. Our retention of your information is governed by applicable law. 
The personal information that you provide us is stored and processed on servers owned by Starbucks and other companies in the United States, Canada or elsewhere around the world, including locations outside of the country or jurisdiction where you are located. Regardless of the company or person who processes your information and where it is processed, we will take steps to transfer and protect your information through appropriate safeguards in accordance with applicable data protection laws and this Notice.
10. Children’s Privacy
We do not intend for our websites or online services to be used by anyone under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect, sell, or share information of consumers between the ages of 13 – 16.  If you are a parent or guardian and believe we may have collected information about your child, please contact us immediately as described in the “Contact Us” section of this Notice. For more information, please see our Terms of Use. 
11. Starbucks Wi-Fi
Many Starbucks stores support providing you access to wireless internet (WiFi) at no charge. For any such WiFi access, please carefully review the terms of use listed on the activation page prior to accepting and connecting.
12. Your Choices & Rights, including State-Specific Rights  
(a)  Your Choices
Location Services – In order to use certain Starbucks Services, such as mobile order and pay (“MOP”) and location-based services and technology, you must either (a) enable “location services” in the Starbucks App; and/or (b) set the permissions in your mobile device to allow communication of this information.

If you allow for location sharing, your device may communicate with us in ways that allow for us to customize your experience in and around Starbucks stores, to monitor the effectiveness of our marketing efforts, to tailor messages based on your time and location patterns, and to limit the number of times you see a promotional message or offer. Precise geolocation may be used to fulfill services and application functionality you choose to engage with. You can manage the use of that personal information at any time in your device settings.

For most mobile devices, you can disable the collection of geolocation information by turning off location services on your device.  If you have any questions about how to prevent Starbucks from collecting your geolocation, we recommend you contact your mobile device service provider or the device manufacturer. Certain Starbucks App features and some Starbucks Services may not work properly without information about your location. You can re-enable the collection of geolocation information, at any time, by turning on location services on your device.
Voice Ordering – In order to use certain Starbucks Services,  such as voice ordering, when available, you must (a) enable “microphone” and “speech recognition” in the Starbucks App; and/or (b) set the permissions in your mobile device to allow communication of this information.
Email Communications, Push Notifications, and In-App Messages– The Starbucks App allows all users to set preferences for receiving promotional email communications from Starbucks, receiving push notifications on your device, and receiving inbox messages. You may opt-out of receiving promotional emails at any time by adjusting your Starbucks online account settings or by clicking the “unsubscribe” link included within any promotional emails we send you. If you opt-out of receiving promotional emails from us, we may still send communications to you about your orders and transactions, and any accounts you have with us. Please note that when you opt-out of receiving promotional emails, you may still receive automated marketing text messages if you have opted-in to receiving them.
Text Messages – In connection with certain Starbucks Services you may consent to receiving automated marketing text messages. You may opt-out of receiving automated marketing text messages at any time by texting any of the following replies at the end of any text message you receive: STOP, END, CANCEL, UNSUBSCRIBE, or QUIT. Please note that when you opt-out of receiving automated marketing text messages you may still receive promotional emails.
If you use the Starbucks App features described above, you consent to the transmission of your user information to Starbucks and/or its agents, and authorize Starbucks and/or its agents, to record, process, and store such user information as necessary for administering the Starbucks App features and for purposes described in this Notice.
(b)  Your Rights, including State-Specific Rights
Depending on where you live (including California, Colorado, Connecticut, Nevada, Utah, Virginia, and Washington), you may be entitled to certain rights with respect to your personal information, as described below.
Right to Know – You may have the right to know what personal information the business has collected about you, including the categories of personal information, the categories of sources from which it is collected, the business or commercial purposes for collecting, selling, or sharing it, and the categories of third parties to whom we disclose it.
Access and Data Portability – Subject to certain exceptions, you may have the right to request a copy of the personal information that we collected about you during the 12 months before your request.
Deletion – You may have the right to request that we delete information that we collected from you and retained, subject to certain exceptions.
Correct Inaccurate Information – You may have the right to request that we correct inaccuracies in the personal information we maintain about you.  You may also correct information about you for Starbucks Rewards in the Starbucks App.
Targeted Advertising – We do not sell your information for monetary or valuable consideration.  You may have the right to opt-out of having your personal information shared for purposes of targeted advertising.  To opt-out, click this “Do Not Share My Personal Information” link.
Sensitive Information – Companies who collect, use, and disclose your sensitive personal information for purposes other than to provide you with goods or services are required to provide you with the right to limit the use and disclosure of your sensitive personal information by providing a “Limit the Use and Disclosure of My Sensitive Personal Information” link. Starbucks only collects, uses, and discloses your sensitive personal information to provide services to you, therefore Starbucks is not required to provide this link.
Opt-Out Preference Signals – Some web browsers allow customers to automatically exercise their right to opt-out of sale/sharing with all businesses they interact with online by initiating an opt-out preference signal. We will honor such opt-out preference signals.
Appeals – You may appeal our decision with respect to a request you have submitted by contacting us as described in the “Contact Us” section below.
Consumer Health Data Rights in Washington and Nevada – You may have additional rights relating to consumer health data. For more information, please see the Consumer Health Data Privacy Notice for Washington and Nevada .
Requests for U.S. residents should be submitted through this form HERE.
Request for Canadian residents should be submitted through this form HERE.
U.S. and Canadian residents may also submit request by calling 1-800-STARBUC (782-7282).  Once we receive your request, we may verify it by requesting information sufficient to confirm your identity.  You may be entitled to submit a request through an authorized agent or to appeal a refusal to take action on your request.  To designate an authorized agent to exercise your rights, we will require written proof that the authorized agent has been authorized to act on your behalf or a copy of the power-of-attorney document granting that right.
If you are an authorized agent or you are submitting a request on behalf of a customer, please submit your request through this form HERE or via email to privacy@starbucks.com.
(c)  Other California Rights

To request a notice, please submit your request by postal mail to: Starbucks, P.O. Box 20430, Augusta, GA 30916
Some web browsers have a “Do Not Track” preference that transmits a “Do Not Track” header to the websites you visit with information indicating that you do not want your activity to be tracked. We currently do not respond to browser “Do Not Track” signals, as there is no standard for how online services should respond to such signals. As standards develop, we may develop policies for responding to do-not-track signals that we will describe in this Notice.

13.  Notice of Financial Incentive & Starbucks® Rewards
Starbucks® Rewards is one way in which Starbucks endeavors to reward and thank loyal customers for patronizing our business and purchasing Starbucks products.  Starbucks® Rewards members opt in by signing up for Rewards online or through the Starbucks App and are able to earn and accumulate "Stars" that can be redeemed for Starbucks® Rewards benefits at participating Starbucks stores. If you would like to become a Starbucks® Rewards member, please see the Starbucks Rewards Terms of Use available at https://www.starbucks.com/rewards/terms.
Starbucks collects and uses the categories of personal information described in the “Information We Collect” section, including information you voluntarily provide us (such as your name and email), information we collect automatically, and information from other sources to operate the Starbucks® Rewards loyalty program, including to send you promotions, content, and special offers and the other uses described in this Notice.  We work with many service providers and business partners to offer the benefits of our Starbucks® Rewards loyalty program.  Those partners may fall into the following categories: delivery partners, Starbucks global licensees, subsidiaries, and affiliates, and or service providers and business partners.  You can learn about the business partners with whom we share your information by referring to the “How We Disclose Your Information” section.  Starbucks does not assign monetary value for the information we collect through the Starbucks® Rewards loyalty program when sending email communications.  You may opt out of receiving promotional emails at any time by adjusting your Starbucks online account settings, or by clicking the “unsubscribe” link included within any promotional emails we send you. Participation in Starbucks® Rewards is voluntary, and you may withdraw from the Starbucks® Rewards loyalty program by visiting the Account section in the Starbucks App, by requesting deletion of your information by filling out this form HERE, or by calling Starbucks customer service. Please note that by withdrawing from Starbucks® Rewards, you will no longer have access to your Starbucks® Rewards account, but you can otherwise continue to use the Starbucks app. All points and rewards you have earned until the time of withdrawal will no longer be available.  As previously shared, to communicate and provide services to you through the Starbucks® Rewards loyalty program, we need to use your personal information. Therefore, if you choose to delete your personal information from the Starbucks® Rewards loyalty program, we can no longer provide you with services through this loyalty program. 
Based on our reasonable and good faith estimate, we receive value from Starbucks® Rewards in increased customer loyalty and patronage, though any value will vary by Starbucks® Rewards member depending on purchases made, which offers a member takes advantage of, and many other factors.
14. Additional Disclosures for Data Subjects in the EEA, the U.K., and Switzerland
This section provides general information about how Starbucks collects, stores, uses, transfers and otherwise processes personal data in or from certain countries in the European Economic Area, the United Kingdom, and Switzerland (together, for purposes of this section of this Notice, “EEA”), in accordance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and its local implementations. This section does not supersede the applicability of any privacy policy found on the website of an EEA-based Starbucks affiliate with whom you have engaged, as that entity would be the data controller with respect to your personal data and the entity to which your data subject rights requests should be directed.
(a)  Lawful Bases of Processing – Where a Starbucks entity is acting as a data controller that determines the purposes and means of processing your personal data, such as when we collect, use, and share personal data as described in this Notice, we must have a lawful basis for processing for doing so. Our lawful bases for processing personal data include:
to conclude or perform a contract with you, for example to:
process your purchases of or requests for products and services, including delivering
gift cards in accordance with your instructions;
communicate with you about orders, purchases, returns, services, accounts, programs,
contests, and sweepstakes;
for our legitimate business purposes, including to:
respond to your customer service inquiries and requests for information;
maintain, improve, and analyze our websites, mobile applications, ads, and the
products and services we offer;
detect, prevent, or investigate security breaches or fraud; and
facilitate the functionality of our websites and mobile applications;
to comply with our legal obligations, for example to maintain appropriate records for internal administrative purposes and as required by applicable law, and provide important product safety information and notice of product recalls; and
on the basis of your consent, for example to send you via email and other electronic means personalized promotions and special offers or informing you about our brands, products, events, or other promotional purposes.
You can withdraw your consent at any time by modifying your promotional preferences in your Starbucks user account online, or by contacting us as described in the “Contact Us” section below.
(b)  Your EEA Data Subject Rights – Under certain circumstances, by law you have the right to:
Request access to your personal information (commonly known as a “data subject access request”). This enables you to receive a copy of the personal information we hold about you.
Request correction of the personal information that we hold about you.
Request erasure of your personal information. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal information where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it.
Object to processing of your personal information where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party), or where we are processing your personal information for direct marketing purposes.
Request the restriction of processing of your personal information. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of personal information about you.
Request the transfer of your personal information to another party, when possible.
Not be subject to automated decision-making producing legal or significant effects on an individual, which we do not engage in.
To exercise any of these rights, please see the “Your Choices & Rights” section, or contact us as set forth in the “Contact Us” section below and specify which GDPR privacy right(s) you wish to exercise. We must verify your identity in order to honor your request, which we will respond to within 30 days of receipt.
(c)  Retention – As described in the “Retention” section, as a general rule, we keep your data for only as long as it is needed to complete the purpose for which it was collected or as required by law. We may need to keep your data for longer than our specified retention periods to honor your requests, including to continue keeping you opted out of marketing emails, or to comply with legal, regulatory, accounting or other obligations.
(d)  Transfers Outside the EEA – Your personal information may be transferred to, stored, and processed in a country other than the one in which it was collected, including the United States.

Last Revised: September 2024
PLEASE READ THESE TERMS OF USE CAREFULLY. ACCESSING OR USING THIS WEBSITE CONSTITUTES ACCEPTANCE OF THESE TERMS OF USE (“TERMS”), AS SUCH MAY BE REVISED BY STARBUCKS FROM TIME TO TIME, AND IS A BINDING AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE USER (“USER” OR “YOU”) AND STARBUCKS CORPORATION (D/B/A STARBUCKS COFFEE COMPANY) GOVERNING THE USE OF THE WEBSITE. IF USER DOES NOT AGREE TO THESE TERMS, USER SHOULD NOT ACCESS OR USE THIS WEBSITE. THESE TERMS CONTAIN DISCLAIMERS AND OTHER PROVISIONS THAT LIMIT OUR LIABILITY TO USER.
These Terms apply to your access to, and use of, all or part of any website, web application, or mobile application of Starbucks Corporation or its subsidiaries and affiliated companies (collectively, “Starbucks”), including starbucks.com, starbucksreserve.com, starbuckscoffeegear.com, stories.starbucks.com and any other site, mobile application, web application, or online service where these Terms are posted (collectively, the “Sites”). These Terms do not alter in any way the terms or conditions of any other agreement you may have with Starbucks for products, services or otherwise.
In the event there is any conflict or inconsistency between these Terms and any other terms of use that appear on the Sites, these Terms will govern. However, if you navigate away from the Sites to a third-party site, you may be subject to alternative terms and conditions of use, as may be specified on such site, which will govern your use of that site.
While we make reasonable efforts to provide accurate and timely information about Starbucks Corporation on the Sites, you should not assume that the information is always up to date or that the Sites contain all the relevant information available about Starbucks. In particular, if you are making an investment decision regarding Starbucks, please consult a number of different sources, including Starbucks filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
These Terms include an arbitration agreement that governs any disputes between you and us. In arbitration, there is less discovery and appellate review than in court. This arbitration agreement and other provisions will:
Eliminate your right to a trial by jury to the extent allowable under applicable law; and
Substantially affect your rights, including preventing you from bringing, joining or participating in class or consolidated proceedings in arbitration and litigation.
You agree that we may provide notices, disclosures and amendments to these Terms by electronic means, including by changing these Terms by posting revisions on the Sites.

In accordance with the DMCA and other applicable law, Starbucks has also adopted a policy of terminating, in appropriate circumstances and in our sole discretion, users who are deemed to be repeat infringers. Starbucks may also, in its sole discretion, limit access to the Sites and/or terminate the accounts of any users who infringe any intellectual property rights of others, whether or not there is any repeat infringement.
Acceptable Use
User’s use of the Sites, any Content, and any information provided by the User including user names and passwords, addresses, e-mail addresses, phone number, financial information (such as credit card numbers), information related to a Starbucks Card, employer name, or GPS location (“User Information”) transmitted in connection with the Sites is limited to the contemplated functionality of the Sites. In no event may the Sites be used in a manner that (a) harasses, abuses, stalks, threatens, defames, or otherwise infringes or violates the rights of any other party (including but not limited to rights of publicity or other proprietary rights); (b) is unlawful, fraudulent, or deceptive; (c) provides sensitive personal information unless specifically requested by Starbucks, (d) includes spam or any unsolicited advertising; (e) uses technology or other means to access Starbucks or Content that is not authorized by Starbucks; (f) uses or launches any automated system, including without limitation, “robots,” “spiders,” or “offline readers,” to access Starbucks or Content; (g) attempts to introduce viruses or any other computer code, files, or programs that interrupt, destroy, or limit the functionality of any computer software, hardware, or telecommunications equipment; (h) attempts to gain unauthorized access to Starbucks’ computer network or user accounts; (i) encourages conduct that would constitute a criminal offense or that gives rise to civil liability; (j) violates these Terms; (k) attempts to damage, disable, overburden, or impair Starbucks’ servers or networks; (l) impersonates any person or entity or otherwise misrepresents your identity or affiliation with another person or entity; or (m) fails to comply with applicable third party terms (collectively “Acceptable Use”). Starbucks reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to terminate any User License, terminate any User’s participation in the Sites (including the Mobile Features), remove Content, or assert legal action with respect to Content or use of the Sites, including Mobile Features, that Starbucks reasonably believes is or might be in violation of these Terms, or Starbucks policies including the Starbucks Card Terms and Conditions. Starbucks’ failure or delay in taking such actions does not constitute a waiver of its rights to enforce these Terms. Starbucks requests that Users not use the Sites, including that they not place orders through Mobile Features, while driving.
User Content
Starbucks does not control, take responsibility for or assume liability for any User Content posted, stored or uploaded by you or any third party, or for any loss or damage thereto, nor is Starbucks liable for any user conduct or any mistakes, defamation, slander, libel, omissions, falsehoods, obscenity, pornography or profanity you may encounter. The interactive areas are generally designed as open and public community areas for connecting and sharing with other people. When you participate in these areas, you understand that certain information and content you choose to post may be displayed publicly. You are solely responsible for your use of the Sites and agree to use the interactive areas at your own risk.
If you become aware of User Content that you believe violates these Terms (with the exception of copyright infringement which is addressed in the Digital Millennium Copyright Act Notice section), you may report it by clicking on the "Report Abuse" or "Flag" links located just below each piece of User Content. Enforcement of these Terms however, is solely in our discretion and absence of enforcement in some instances does not constitute a waiver of our right to enforce the Terms in other instances. In addition, these Terms do not create any private right of action on the part of any third party or any reasonable expectation or promise that the Sites will not contain any content that is prohibited by these Terms. Although Starbucks has no obligation to screen, edit or monitor any of the User Content posted on the Sites, Starbucks reserves the right, and has absolute discretion, to remove, screen or edit any User Content on the Sites at any time and for any reason without notice. You are solely responsible for creating backup copies and replacing any User Content you post or store on the Sites at your sole cost and expense.
If you are viewing the Sites on a public computer or are otherwise using a computer to which multiple people have potential access, be sure to follow all relevant instructions to ensure you are sufficiently disconnected and logged off the Sites and the computer system you are using to prevent unauthorized User Content.
You represent and warrant that your User Content is not subject to any confidentiality obligations and that you own and control all of the rights to the User Content, have the lawful right to distribute and produce such User Content, or otherwise have the right to grant the rights to Starbucks that you grant herein. Starbucks claims no ownership or control over any User Content, except as otherwise provided herein, on the Sites or in a separate agreement. However, by submitting or posting User Content on the Sites, you grant Starbucks and its designees a worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable, non-exclusive, fully-paid up and royalty free license to use, sell, reproduce, prepare derivative works, combine with other works, alter, translate, distribute copies, display, perform, publish, license or sub-license the User Content and your name and likeness provided in connection with such use of your User Content. By posting User Content, you hereby release Starbucks and its agents and employees from any claims that such use, as authorized above, violates any of your rights and you understand that you will not be entitled to any compensation for any use of your User Content.
Submission of Ideas
Separate and apart from the User Content you provide, you may submit questions, comments, feedback, suggestions, ideas, improvements, plans, notes, drawings, original or creative materials or other information about Starbucks, our Sites and our products (collectively, "Ideas"). The Ideas you submit are voluntary, non-confidential, gratuitous and non-committal. Please do not send us Ideas if you expect to be paid or want to continue to own or claim rights in them; your Ideas might be great, but we may have already had the same or similar idea and we do not want disputes. You must also inform us if you have a pending or registered patent relative to the Idea.
You represent and warrant that your Idea is not subject to any confidentiality obligations or third party intellectual property encumbrances and that you own and control all of the rights to the Idea and have the authority to grant the rights to Starbucks that you grant herein.
By submitting your Idea, you grant Starbucks and its designees a worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable, non-exclusive, fully-paid up and royalty free license to use, sell, reproduce, prepare derivative works, combine with other works, alter, translate, distribute copies, display, perform, publish, license or sub-license the Idea and shall be entitled to the unrestricted use and dissemination of Ideas for any purpose, commercial or otherwise, without acknowledgment or compensation to you. By submitting your Idea, you hereby release Starbucks and its agents and employees from any claims that such use violates any of your rights.
Starbucks shall own exclusive rights, including all intellectual property rights, to any work it creates or has created from the Idea or a similar idea of its own.
Links to Sites
You are granted a limited, non-exclusive right to create text hyperlinks to the Sites for noncommercial purposes, provided such links do not portray Starbucks in a false, misleading, derogatory or otherwise defamatory manner and provided further that the linking site does not contain any obscene, pornographic, sexually explicit or illegal material or any material that is offensive, harassing or otherwise objectionable. This limited right may be revoked at any time. In addition, you may not use Starbucks' logo or other proprietary graphics to link to our Sites without our express written permission. Further, you may not use, frame or utilize framing techniques to enclose any Starbucks trademark, logo or other proprietary information, including the images found at the Sites, the content of any text or the layout/design of any page or form contained on a page on the Sites without our express written consent. Except as noted above, you are not conveyed any right or license by implication, estoppel or otherwise in or under any patent, trademark, copyright or proprietary right of Starbucks or any third party. Starbucks makes no claim or representation regarding, and accepts no responsibility for, the quality, content, nature or reliability of websites linking to the Sites. Such sites are not under the control of Starbucks and Starbucks is not responsible for the content of any linked site or any link contained in a linked site, or any review, changes or updates to such sites.
Indemnification
The User agrees to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless Starbucks, its parent, subsidiary and other affiliated companies, independent contractors, service providers and consultants, and their respective employees, contractors, agents, officers, and directors (“Starbucks Indemnitees”) from any and all claims, suits, damages, costs, lawsuits, fines, penalties, liabilities, and expenses (including attorneys’ fees) (“Claims”) that arise from or relate to the User’s use or misuse of the Sites,(including Mobile Features), violation of these Terms, violation of any rights of a third party, any User Content or Ideas you provide, or your conduct in connection with the Sites. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this indemnification provision shall not apply to any Claims caused by a Starbucks Indemnitee’s sole negligence. Starbucks reserves the right to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter otherwise subject to indemnification by the User, in which event the User will cooperate in asserting any available defenses.

Third Party Content, Sites, Products and Services (including Advertising and Promotions)
Starbucks may provide third party content on the Sites (including embedded content) or links to third-party web pages, content, applications, products and services, including advertisements and promotions (collectively, “Third Party Content”) as a service to those interested in such services or information. We do not control, endorse or adopt any Third-Party Content, including that the inclusion of any link does not imply affiliation, endorsement or adoption by Starbucks of any site or any information contained therein, and can make no guarantee as to its accuracy or completeness. You acknowledge and agree that Starbucks is not responsible or liable in any manner for any Third-Party Content or services provided by such third parties, and undertakes no responsibility to update or review such Third-Party Content. You agree to use such Third-Party Content or services contained therein at your own risk. When you use or visit other sites via Third-Party Content, or participate in promotions or business dealings with third parties, you should understand that our terms and policies no longer govern, and that the terms and policies of those third-party sites will now apply. You should review the applicable terms and policies, including privacy and data gathering practices, of any site to which you navigate from our Sites. You must comply with any applicable third-party terms when using the Sites.
Modifications to the Sites
Starbucks reserves the right to modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, the Sites or any features or portions thereof without prior notice. You agree that Starbucks will not be liable for any modification, suspension or discontinuance of the Sites or any part thereof.
Financial Material Disclosures
Forward-Looking Statements: The Sites, and any documents issued by Starbucks and available through the Sites, may contain statements which constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements can be identified by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. They often include words such as “believes,” “expects,” “anticipates,” “estimates,” “intends,” “plans,” “seeks” or words of similar meaning, or future or conditional verbs, such as “will,” “should,” “could” or “may.” Forward-looking statements include statements made as to future operations, costs, capital expenditures, cash flow, product developments, operating efficiencies, sales and earnings estimates or trends and expansion plans, initiatives and projections. These forward-looking statements are based on our expectations as of the date such forward-looking statements are made and are neither predictions nor guarantees of future events or circumstances. Actual future results and trends may differ materially depending on a variety of factors including the risks detailed in the company’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the “Risk Factors” section of Starbucks Annual Report on Form 10-K for the most recent fiscal year ended. The company assumes no obligation to update any of these forward-looking statements.
Press Releases: The information contained within press releases issued by Starbucks should not be deemed accurate or current except as of the date the release was posted. Starbucks specifically disclaims any duty to update, the information in the press releases. To the extent any information therein is forward-looking it is intended to fit within the safe harbor for forward-looking statements and is subject to material risk.
Third-Party Financial Information: As a service, Starbucks may provide links to third-party websites or services that contain financial or investment information about Starbucks. Starbucks neither regularly monitors nor has control over the content of third parties' statements or websites. Accordingly, Starbucks does not endorse or adopt, nor make any representations or warranties whatsoever regarding the accuracy or completeness, of those websites or any information contained therein, including, without limitation, analysts' reports and stock quotes. Users visit these websites and use the information contained therein at their own risk.
Dispute Resolution (including Arbitration Agreement; Class Action Waiver; Jury Trial Waiver)
Please read this section carefully. It affects your legal rights. It provides for resolution of most disputes through individual arbitration instead of court trials and class actions. Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court, uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, and discovery is more limited. Arbitration is final and binding and subject to only very limited review by a court. This section also contains a jury trial waiver and a waiver of any and all rights to proceed in a class, collective, consolidated, private attorney general or representative action in arbitration, or litigation to the fullest extent allowable by applicable law.
Arbitration Agreement.
Binding Arbitration. This provision is intended to be interpreted broadly. Any dispute or claim arising out of or relating to these Terms, your use of the Sites, or your relationship with Starbucks or any past, present, or future subsidiary, parent or affiliate company or companies, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, (“Dispute”) will be resolved through binding individual arbitration, except that either of us may take a Dispute to small claims court so long as it isn’t removed or appealed to a court of general jurisdiction. Dispute shall include, but not be limited to: (a) any dispute or claim that arose before the existence of these or any prior Terms (including, but not limited to, claims relating to advertising); (b) any dispute or claim that is currently the subject of purported class action litigation in which you are not a member of a certified class; and (c) any dispute or claim that may arise after termination of these Terms. Dispute, however, does not include disagreements or claims concerning patents, copyrights, trademarks, and trade secrets and claims of piracy or unauthorized use of intellectual property. The arbitrator shall decide all issues except the following (which are for a court of competent jurisdiction to decide): (a) issues that are reserved for a court in these Terms; (b) issues that relate to the scope, validity, and enforceability of the arbitration agreement, class action waiver, or any of the provisions of this Dispute Resolution section; and (c) issues that relate to the arbitrability of any Dispute. These Terms and this arbitration agreement do not prevent you from bringing a Dispute to the attention of any government agency. You and we agree that these Terms evidence a transaction in interstate commerce and that this arbitration agreement will be interpreted and enforced in accordance with the Federal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law.
Mandatory Informal Dispute Resolution Process. You and we agree to work together in an effort to informally resolve any Dispute between us. The party initiating the Dispute must send the other a written notice of the Dispute that includes all of this information: (a) information sufficient to identify any transaction and account at issue; (b) contact information (including name, address, telephone number, and email address); and (c) a detailed description of the nature and basis of the Dispute and the relief sought, including a calculation for it. The notice must be personally signed by the party initiating the Dispute (and their counsel, if represented). If you have the Dispute with us, you must send this notice to our Customer Service department using the appropriate link at https://customerservice.starbucks.com/app/contact/ask/. If we have a Dispute with you, we will send this notice to the most recent contact information we have for you. For a period of 60 days from receipt of a completed notice (which can be extended by agreement of the parties), you and we agree to negotiate in good faith in an effort to informally resolve the Dispute. The party receiving the notice may request a telephone settlement conference to aid in the resolution of the Dispute. If such a conference is requested, you and a Starbucks representative will personally attend (with counsel, if represented). The conference will be scheduled for a mutually convenient time, which may be outside of the 60-day period. Completion of this Mandatory Informal Dispute Resolution Process (“Process”) is a condition precedent to initiating a claim in arbitration. If the sufficiency of a notice or compliance with this Process is at issue, such issue may be raised with and decided by a court of competent jurisdiction at either party’s election, and any arbitration shall be stayed. The court shall have the authority to enforce this condition precedent to arbitration, which includes the power to enjoin the filing or prosecution of arbitrations and the assessment or collection of arbitration fees. Nothing in this paragraph limits the right of a party to seek damages for non-compliance with this Process in arbitration. All applicable limitations periods (including statutes of limitations) will be tolled from the date of receipt of a completed notice through the conclusion of this Process. You or we may commence arbitration if the Dispute is not resolved through this Process.
Arbitration Procedures. The arbitration of any Dispute shall be administered by and conducted in accordance with the rules of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”), including the AAA’s Consumer Arbitration Rules (as applicable) (“AAA Rules”), as modified by this arbitration agreement. The AAA Rules are available online at www.adr.org. You and we understand and agree that the AAA’s administrative determination that this arbitration agreement comports with the Consumer Due Process Protocols is final and that neither a court nor an arbitrator has the authority to revisit it. If the AAA is unavailable or unwilling to administer the arbitration consistent with this arbitration agreement, the parties shall agree on an administrator that will do so. If the parties cannot agree, they shall petition a court of competent jurisdiction to appoint an administrator that will do so. 
An arbitration demand must be accompanied by a certification of compliance with the Process and be personally signed by the party initiating arbitration (and counsel, if represented). By submitting an arbitration demand, the party and counsel represent that, as in court, that they are complying with the requirements of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b). The arbitrator is authorized to impose any sanctions available under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11 on represented parties and their counsel. You may choose to have the arbitration conducted by a phone, video, or in-person hearing, or through written submissions, except any Dispute seeking $25,000 or more, or injunctive relief, shall have an in-person or video hearing unless the parties agree otherwise. You and we reserve the right to request a hearing in any matter from the arbitrator. You and a Starbucks representative will personally appear at any hearing (with counsel, if represented). Any in-person hearing will be held in the county or parish in which you reside or at another mutually agreed location. An arbitrator may award on an individual basis any relief that would be available in a court, including injunctive or declaratory relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party’s individual claim. To the fullest extent allowable by applicable law, you and we agree that each may bring claims against the other only in your or our individual capacity and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class, collective, consolidated, private attorney general, or representative proceeding. Further, unless both you and we agree otherwise, an arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims and may not otherwise preside over any form of class, collective, consolidated, private attorney general, or representative proceeding. An arbitrator must follow and enforce these Terms as a court would. If, after exhaustion of all appeals, any of these prohibitions on non-individualized injunctive or declaratory relief and class, collective, consolidated, private attorney general, or representative proceedings are found to be unenforceable with respect to a particular claim or request for relief (such as a request for public injunctive relief), then such a claim or request for relief will be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction, after all other claims and requests for relief are arbitrated. 
The arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain essential findings and conclusions. The arbitrator shall apply the cost-shifting provisions of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 68 after entry of an award. Judgment on any arbitration award may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction, except an award that has been satisfied may not be entered. An award shall have no preclusive effect in any other arbitration or proceeding in which you are not a named party.
Costs of Arbitration. Payment of arbitration fees will be governed by the AAA Rules and fee schedule. You and we agree that the parties have a shared interest in reducing the costs and increasing the efficiencies associated with arbitration. Therefore, you or we may elect to engage with the AAA regarding arbitration fees, and you and we agree that the parties (and counsel, if represented) will work together in good faith to ensure that arbitration remains cost-effective for all parties.
Additional Procedures for Multiple Case Filings. You and we agree that these Additional Procedures for Multiple Case Filings (in addition to the other provisions of this arbitration agreement) shall apply if you choose to participate in a Multiple Case Filing. If 25 or more similar Disputes (including yours) are asserted against Starbucks by the same or coordinated counsel or are otherwise coordinated (“Multiple Case Filing”), the resolution of your Dispute might be delayed and ultimately proceed in court. The parties agree that as part of these procedures, their counsel shall meet and confer in good faith in an effort to resolve the Disputes, streamline procedures, address the exchange of information, modify the number of Disputes to be adjudicated, and conserve the parties’ and the AAA’s resources.
If your claim is part of a Multiple Case Filing, any applicable limitations periods (including statutes of limitations) shall be tolled for your Dispute from the time that your Dispute is first submitted to the AAA until your Dispute is selected to proceed as part of a staged process or is settled, withdrawn, otherwise resolved, or opted out of arbitration pursuant to this provision.
STAGE ONE: If at least 100 Disputes are submitted as part of the Multiple Case Filing, counsel for the claimants and counsel for Starbucks shall each select 50 Disputes to be filed and to proceed as cases in individual arbitrations as part of this initial staged process. The number of Disputes to be selected to proceed in Stage One can be increased by agreement of counsel for the parties (and if there are fewer than 100 Disputes, all shall proceed individually in Stage One). Each of the 100 (or fewer) cases shall be assigned to a different arbitrator and proceed individually. If a case is withdrawn before the issuance of an arbitration award, another claim shall be selected to proceed as part of Stage One. The remaining Disputes shall not be filed or deemed filed in arbitration nor shall any arbitration fees be assessed or collected in connection with those claims. After this initial set of proceedings, counsel for the parties shall participate in a global mediation session with a retired federal or state court judge jointly selected by counsel in an effort to resolve the remaining Disputes (as informed by the adjudications of cases in Stage One), and Starbucks shall pay the mediator’s fee.
STAGE TWO: If the remaining Disputes have not been resolved at the conclusion of Stage One, counsel for the claimants and counsel for Starbucks shall each select 100 Disputes per side to be filed and to proceed as cases in individual arbitrations as part of a second staged process. The number of Disputes to be selected to proceed as part of this second staged process can be increased by agreement of counsel for the parties (and if there are fewer than 200 Disputes, all shall proceed individually in Stage Two). No more than five cases may be assigned to a single arbitrator to proceed individually. If a case is withdrawn before the issuance of an arbitration award, another claim shall be selected to proceed as part of Stage Two. The remaining Disputes shall not be filed or deemed filed in arbitration nor shall any arbitration fees be assessed or collected in connection with those claims. After this second set of staged proceedings, the parties shall engage in a global mediation session of all remaining Disputes with a retired federal or state court judge jointly selected by counsel in an effort to resolve the remaining Disputes (as informed by the adjudications of cases in Stages One and Two), and Starbucks shall pay the mediator’s fee.
Upon the completion of the mediation set forth in Stage Two, each remaining Dispute (if any) that is not settled or not withdrawn shall be opted out of arbitration and may proceed in a court of competent jurisdiction consistent with the remainder of the Terms. Notwithstanding the foregoing, counsel for the parties may mutually agree in writing to proceed with the adjudication of some or all of the remaining Disputes in individual arbitrations consistent with the process set forth in Stage Two (except Disputes shall be randomly selected and mediation shall be elective by agreement of counsel) or through another mutually-agreeable process. A court of competent jurisdiction shall have the authority to enforce the Additional Procedures for Multiple Case Filings, including the power to enjoin the filing or prosecution of arbitrations and the assessment or collection of arbitration fees.
The Additional Procedures for Multiple Case Filings provision and each of its requirements are essential parts of this arbitration agreement. If, after exhaustion of all appeals, a court of competent jurisdiction decides that the Additional Procedures for Multiple Case Filings apply to your Dispute and are not enforceable, then your Dispute shall not proceed in arbitration and shall only proceed in a court of competent jurisdiction consistent with the remainder of the Terms.
Future Changes to Arbitration Agreement. If we make any future changes to this arbitration agreement (other than a change to our contact information), you may reject any such change by sending your personally signed, written notice to the following address within 30 days of the change:

Starbucks Corporation
Law & Corporate Affairs
2401 Utah Ave S, MS:S-LA1, Seattle, WA 98134
Attention: Litigation Department
Such written notice does not constitute an opt out of arbitration altogether. By rejecting any future change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any Dispute between you and Starbucks in accordance with this version of the arbitration agreement.
Class Action Waiver and Jury Trial Waiver.
You and we each agree that any proceeding, whether in arbitration or in court, will be conducted only on an individual basis and not in a class, collective, consolidated, private attorney general, or representative action. You and we agree to waive any right to bring or to participate in such an action in arbitration or in court to the fullest extent allowable by applicable law. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the parties retain the right to participate in a class-wide settlement.
To the fullest extent allowable by applicable law, you and we waive the right to a jury trial. 
Governing Law and Jurisdiction
These Terms and use of the Sites are governed by the laws of the state of Washington, United States of America, without regard to Washington’s conflict of laws rules. The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods shall have no applicability. If the arbitration agreement is ever deemed unenforceable or void, or a dispute between the parties is not subject to arbitration, the User irrevocably consents to the exclusive jurisdiction of the federal and state courts in King County, Washington, United States of America, for purposes of any legal action arising out of or related to the use of the Sites or these Terms, and waives any objections as to personal jurisdiction or as to the laying of venue in such courts due to: (a) inconvenient forum or (b) any other basis or any right to seek to transfer or change venue of any such action to another court.
Termination
Notwithstanding any of these Terms, Starbucks reserves the right, without notice and in its sole discretion, to terminate your license to use the Sites and to block or prevent your future access to and use of the Sites. Starbucks’ failure or delay in taking such actions does not constitute a waiver of its rights to enforce these Terms.
Changes
Starbucks reserves the right to change or modify these Terms or any other Starbucks policies related to use of the Sites at any time and at its sole discretion by posting revisions on the Sites. Continued use of the Sites following such changes or modifications to the Terms or other Starbucks policies will constitute acceptance of such changes or modifications. If you do not agree to such changes or modifications, you should cease using the Sites immediately.
Severability and Survival
Except as otherwise provided herein, if any provision of these Terms shall be deemed unlawful, void or for any reason unenforceable, then that provision shall be deemed severable from these Terms and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.
In addition to such other provisions hereof which, by their terms, survive any termination or expiration of this Agreement, the following sections shall survive termination of these Terms: (a) Indemnification; (b) Warranties; Disclaimers; (c) No Liability; (d) Dispute Resolution (including Arbitration Agreement; Class Action Waiver; Jury Trial Waiver); and (e) Governing Law and Jurisdiction.

SYSTEMS ANALYST
I was at the point where I wanted to continue my education and I knew there was an opportunity to do so with the Starbucks College Achievement Plan (SCAP). I cannot stress enough that I am a different person because of this company. It has truly shaped me as a person and taught me that what I value most professionally and personally is a sense of togetherness through community.

How do I order Starbucks® delivery?
You can order Starbucks® delivery through DoorDash, Uber Eats or Grubhub.

Can I get the full menu of items available at my local Starbucks® store delivered?
To maintain the high standards of quality and consistency we know you expect from us, we’ve optimized our menu for Starbucks® delivery. Consequently, select items are currently unavailable for Starbucks® delivery.

Can I pay for Starbucks® delivery with my Starbucks card or through the Starbucks app?
Paying for delivery with a Starbucks Card or app isn’t supported at this time.

We are encouraged by our Q1 results, which demonstrated the effectiveness of our 'Back to Starbucks' strategy, evidenced by our top-line trend. Although we are in the beginning chapter, and have much more work ahead of us, we will continue to prioritize shareholder value through dividends, providing a predictable return of capital while we turn around our business.

It is fun when you DO have the time to write a nice message
No more than a smile or a hearth can be put on a cup during peak
Wouldn’t it be better to focus on the crafting of the drink

Commitment to inclusion and accessibility
Starbucks mission is “With every cup, with every conversation, with every community – we nurture the limitless possibilities for human connection.”

In support of our mission, we’re committed to upholding a culture where inclusion, diversity, equity and accessibility are valued and respected. Together with our community partners, we are increasing accessibility resources and supporting the development of evolving employer practices on access and disability inclusion. If you have questions, please visit our customer service page.
Inclusive spaces
Starbucks is committed to expanding accessibility in the store experience across its store portfolio through an Inclusive Spaces Framework. Building on the company’s commitment to inclusion, the new design framework defines how Starbucks will help expand independence, choice and ease for all people across physical and digital spaces. The Inclusive Spaces Framework was created in partnership with a diverse community of customers, partners and accessibility experts to develop scalable solutions for retail spaces (more details available here).

The first store to be built using the inclusive design framework opened in Washington, D.C. in February 2024 (press release available here). Moving forward, all newly built and renovated Starbucks company-operated stores in North America will begin to incorporate the framework, a key milestone in ensuring Starbucks continues to expand accessibility and inclusion. The framework is an openly available tool and will be further developed with other companies to help expand accessibility across the retail industry. The framework is currently downloadable at www.designinclusivespaces.com.
Digital accessibility
We are working to ensure that all Starbucks digital properties are accessible for all partners and customers. Starbucks efforts to improve digital usability and accessibility are guided by recommendations established by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), which includes the currently approved Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) Levels A and AA. We are also firmly dedicated to complying with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) 2010, U.S. Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (or “Section 508” 36 CFR 1194), the Accessible Canada Act (ACA), and the Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act (AODA).

Our efforts are ongoing as we continue to develop our digital accessibility program, which includes coordination with internal and external accessibility partners, as well as designing, developing, and testing Starbucks digital properties for accessibility.
Digital accessibility feedback
Digital Accessibility requests are managed by the Digital Accessibility team during business hours (Pacific time) and weekdays only. For general concerns such as trouble signing into your Starbucks account, quality of your Starbucks store experience, or any other feedback or issues not related to digital accessibility, please visit our customer service page where you’ll find quicker support options.

If you are a customer with a disability, or are an individual assisting someone with a disability, and you are experiencing issues accessing any Starbucks digital content, please select the contact form link below. You may also use this form to request information about Starbucks digital accessibility efforts, or share any accessibility questions or feedback:
Digital accessibility contact form
Disclaimer
Please be aware that our efforts to maintain accessibility and usability are ongoing. While we strive to make the Starbucks website and mobile apps as accessible as possible some issues may be encountered by different assistive technology as the range of assistive technology is wide and varied. We appreciate your understanding.

Our Company
Our Heritage
Our story begins in 1971 along the cobblestone streets of Seattle’s historic Pike Place Market. It was here where Starbucks opened its first store, offering fresh-roasted coffee beans, tea and spices from around the world for our customers to take home. Our name was inspired by the classic tale, “Moby-Dick,” evoking the seafaring tradition of the early coffee traders.
Ten years later, a young New Yorker named Howard Schultz would walk through these doors and become captivated with Starbucks coffee from his first sip. After joining the company in 1982, a different cobblestone road would lead him to another discovery. It was on a trip to Milan in 1983 that Howard first experienced Italy’s coffeehouses, and he returned to Seattle inspired to bring the warmth and artistry of its coffee culture to Starbucks. By 1987, we swapped our brown aprons for green ones and embarked on our next chapter as a coffeehouse.
Starbucks would soon expand to Chicago and Vancouver, Canada and then on to California, Washington, D.C. and New York. By 1996, we would cross the Pacific to open our first store in Japan, followed by Europe in 1998 and China in 1999. Over the next two decades, we would grow to welcome millions of customers each week and become a part of the fabric of tens of thousands of neighborhoods all around the world. In everything we do, we are always dedicated to Our Mission: With every cup, with every conversation, with every community - we nurture the limitless possibilities of human connection.
Coffee & Craft
It takes many hands to craft the perfect cup of coffee – from the farmers who tend to the red-ripe coffee cherries, to the master roasters who coax the best from every bean, and to the barista who serves it with care. We are committed to the highest standards of quality and service, embracing our heritage while innovating to create new experiences to savor.
Learn more
Our Partners
We like to say that we are not in the coffee business serving people, but in the people business serving coffee. Our employees – who we call partners – are at the heart of the Starbucks experience. We are committed to making our partners proud and investing in their health, well-being and success and to creating a culture of belonging where everyone is welcome.
Explore Careers
We Believe in the Pursuit of Doing Good
As it has been from the beginning, our purpose goes far beyond profit. We believe Starbucks can, and should, have a positive impact on the communities we serve.
People
Our aspiration is to be people positive – investing in humanity and the well-being of everyone we connect with, from our partners to coffee farmers to the customers in our stores and beyond.
Learn more
Planet
We are striving to become resource positive – giving back more than we take from the planet. We are working to store more carbon than we emit, replenish more freshwater than we use, and eliminate waste. We know we can’t do it alone. It takes all of us.

BELONGING AT STARBUCKS
CREATING A MORE WELCOMING ENVIRONMENT
Explore
At Starbucks, we are committed to creating environments where everyone is welcome and belongs. In 2023, we reaffirmed this commitment by cementing Belonging as one of our company values.
Starbucks is dedicated to being an inclusive, equitable, accessible  and diverse company, with a responsibility to help create opportunity and advance equity in every community we serve. We do this by fostering an inclusive culture that values diverse perspectives and experiences.  
SUPPORTING OUR OBJECTIVES
Starbucks has established programs and initiatives aimed at supporting our strategic objectives and helping our partners thrive – both individually and collectively.
With feedback from our partners and communities, we continue to make improvements and changes to our approach to ensure that opportunities and resources are distributed consistently and equitably, allowing all individuals to actively engage and contribute to our organization.  
Strengthening Career journeys
As we enter 2025, we will focus on creating opportunity for thousands of partners to grow their careers with Starbucks and measure our progress with a goal to hire internally for 90% of our retail leadership roles. We know that achieving this will take a continued commitment to training, mentorship, and career development. Our current workforce diversity data, including that of our partners who wear the green apron is here.
Starbucks Partner Networks
Partner Networks create moments of connection that promote diversity, foster inclusion and contribute to the success of our partners and our company. Starbucks has 14 Partner Networks, open to all partners, with 100+ regional chapters across the U.S. There are also more than 20 Partner Networks available globally.
Starbucks Mentorship Program 
Valuable guidance and networking opportunities are available to all partners to share their experiences, challenges and aspirations.

Programs like To Be Welcoming , developed with Arizona State University, equip managers and partners with the tools necessary to create welcoming store environments. 
Pay equity
We remain focused on addressing barriers impeding equal pay for equal work. We are committed to consistently achieving 100% gender and race pay equity in the U.S.
Workforce diversity
We are expanding workforce diversity to bring new perspectives and experiences that improve our business and workplace. To do this, we reach a broader pool of candidates and talent by prioritizing inclusivity in our recruitment practices, in partner engagement, and by continuing to foster inclusive leadership. We work hard to ensure our hiring practices are competitive, fair and inclusive and that we hire the best person every time.
Community investment
Starbucks Community Resilience Fund, launched in 2021, will invest $100 million through Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFIs) to support economically disadvantaged communities.

This report also includes data tables that reflect our progress against our goals. A comprehensive view of our progress and reports since 2001 is available here .

Agile and safe clinical trials are key to faster drug development
The need to synthesize data from different sources increases the risk of regulatory non-compliance for pharma companies. As a result, they face an exponential increase in clinical research and development costs, sub-optimal clinical trial execution, and delays in launching new, approved drugs. TCS ADD™ enables digital ecosystems, simplifies data complexity, and drives innovation in clinical trials to bring drugs to market faster.

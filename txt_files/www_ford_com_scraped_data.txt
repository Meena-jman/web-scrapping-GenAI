Drag or resistance produced by a moving object, such as a motor vehicle, as it displaces the air in its path
Usually measured in pounds, aerodynamic drag increases in proportion to an object‚Äôs frontal area, drag coefficient and the square of its speed
Air Dam
Soft, lower body extension attached below the front bumper improving vehicle performance by limiting the amount of airflow directed under the vehicle
Improves aerodynamics and redirects the airflow to the engine compartment for improved engine cooling or air conditioning performance
Assists in reducing aerodynamic lift, turbulence and drag
Air Dryer
A component of the air conditioning system
Condenses and filters moisture and contaminants from pressurized air from the air compressor
Most air dryers use a drying agent known as a desiccant to remove moisture from the air
Moisture is automatically expelled when the compressor unloads
Air Suspension Seat
Single seat, either driver or passenger, which incorporates an air-activated suspension system to help eliminate the jolts and bounces of the truck cab
Note: Normally air suspension seats require that the truck be equipped with air brakes to supply air to the seat
Some seats feature an integral air compressor so the occupant can energize the seat on vehicles that are not equipped with air brakes
Air/Fuel Mixture
The measure or ratio of the amounts of air and fuel being fed to the engine‚Äôs cylinders. The power train control module (PCM) computer adjusts the air/fuel mixture to provide the best combination of performance and fuel efficiency
A higher percentage of fuel to air is described as a rich mixture, while a lower percentage of fuel to air is termed a lean mixture
On Ford vehicles, the air/fuel mixture is measured by an electronic sensor that provides input to the power train control module systems
Airbag
During a moderate-to-severe frontal impact, the airbag is designed to inflate in approximately 1/20th of a second (less time than it takes to blink an eye) and begins to deflate immediately thereafter. In that brief period, the airbag can help reduce the risk of injury to the head and chest of the driver and/or the right front seat passenger
Electronic diagnostic module continuously monitors the airbag for proper operation
When the ignition switch is turned to the ON position, the airbag indicator light on the instrument cluster illuminates for approximately six seconds to signal that the system is functioning properly. Should a fault occur in the system, the airbag indicator light flashes, stays on or fails to illuminate when the ignition switch is turned to the Start position. This signifies immediate service is required
Always put small children and child seats in the rear seating positions (except jump seats). Deactivate the passenger airbag with the airbag shutoff switch (if equipped) when using a rear-facing child safety seat in the front passenger seat
Dual-stage Airbags
Can deploy at two different levels, or nor at all, depending on the information sent to the Restraint Control Module from various sensors located within the vehicle
In less severe collision events, the airbags will deploy in the lower or first stage of deployment force
In more severe collision events, airbags will deploy at both stages or at full force
Seat sensors, in some front passenger seats, can detect the weight of passengers and deploy only if the occupant is above a certain weightSecond Generation Airbags
Designed to inflate with less force than that employed in earlier or first generation designs
The airbags reduce the peak inflation pressure and/or rise rate
Rise rate is the force and speed with which an airbag inflates and is controlled by factors such as the type and amount of inflator gas, the actual airbag size and the design of the vent used to release the pressure from the airbag once deployed
Note: The airbag is not a substitute for safety belts. Safety belts must be properly worn at all times to maximize the effectiveness of the system. Always secure children in the back seat (except jump seats).
All-Wheel Drive (AWD)
Continuously monitors wheel speed, throttle position and steering-wheel angle sensors to determine the vehicle‚Äôs conditions and driver‚Äôs intent. The system then determines the optimal amount of front and rear torque for the given conditions to not only reduce wheel slip but to prevent the slip from occurring in the first place
Helps ensure the vehicle will be sure-footed on the road in a variety of conditions, such as fast cornering, uneven pavement, potholes, slippery surfaces and anything that compromises traction
Vehicle normally functions in front-wheel-drive mode
When sensors detect that wheel slip is occurring or even just likely to occur, the All-Wheel-Drive (AWD) system can react within as little as 50 milliseconds to distribute up to 100 percent of the available torque to the rear wheels
Controller may detect a difference in wheel speed front-to-rear even in good weather, such as when driving through sand, mud or wet leaves
How the System Works
All-Wheel Drive uses electromagnetic activation of an internal clutch pack
Engages when sensors detect wheel slip in the front wheels, and often acts preemptively to prevent slip from happening in the first place
When activated, the system uses force from an electromagnet to push clutch plates together
Drive shaft torque is transmitted through the unit to the rear wheels, taking power from the front wheel sand sending it to the rear
Benefits of the System
No driver interaction is required to activate AWD. It‚Äôs there when your customers need it
The system can send up to 100 percent of the engine‚Äôs torque to front or rear as needed to avoid wheel slip
Operates with speed and sophistication to help provide peace of mind and driving confidence
Releases just as quickly, avoiding binding or wheel skid once traction improves
Benefits on either wet or dry pavement. Because the system can transfer torque quickly away from the front wheels, it helps reduce the type of understeer often associated with front-wheel-drive vehicles to provide improved vehicle control
Lightweight with few moving parts, for little impact on fuel economy
When AWD is combined with All-Speed Traction Control or the AdvanceTrac¬Æ system, a high degree of torque can be sent to the wheel with the best traction, even if the other three wheels have no traction at all
Alternative Fuel Vehicle (also see E85 Vehicles and Flexible Fuel Vehicle {FFV})
Refers to any type of vehicle that uses nontraditional fuel or power sources:
Methanol/Ethanol
Compressed Natural Gas (CNG)
Propane
Electricity (as in Escape Hybrid)
Alternator
Engine-driven device that converts mechanical energy into alternating electrical current
Provides power to run all of the vehicle‚Äôs electrical components when the engine is running
Single or dual heavy-duty alternators that provide additional charging capacity are also available for applications such as cold-climate operation (temperatures below -20¬∞F) where battery drain and accessory use are typically very high, and vehicles are equipped for towing purposes
Alternator Capacity
To determine minimum capacity for an alternator:
Minimum alternator output = Total load x 1.20, where total load comprises continuous night-winter load
Add 20 percent (.20) to accommodate anticipated intermittent load
In most cases, a 2.51:1 or better alternator drive ratio will provide a reasonably adequate system output
Ambient Interior Lighting
Utilizes Light-Emitting Diode (LED) lights to illuminate the vehicle interior: foot wells, cup holders, and controls, depending upon the vehicle
Offers the ability to change color to suit your mood. Color selections include aqua, blue, green, purple, red, yellow or white lighting
Anti-theft Systems
Perimeter anti-theft alarm system
Guards the vehicle's doors, hood and trunk/lift gate. When an unauthorized entry occurs, the system trigger sand will:‚Äì Flash the head lamps, parking lamps and theft-indicator lamp on the instrument panel
Sound the horn. Note: It will not be triggered by breaking glass or entry into the vehicle through a window. The perimeter anti-theft alarm system is designed to work with the factory-installed Remote Keyless Entry System. SecuriLock¬Æ passive anti-theft ignition system
Uses a sophisticated electronically coded ignition key to start the vehicle. The system is designed to help prevent the engine from being started unless a coded key programmed to the vehicle is used. There is no battery on the key itself; the small amount of energy required to identify the key is supplied by the vehicle
SecuriLock is designed so that it is not necessary for the driver to follow any procedure to arm the system. It is automatically armed when the key is removed from the ignition and is disarmed when the key is reinserted into the ignition
Spare keys will be available from dealerships. Customers can program their keys by using each original (2) key in the proper sequence and finally inserting a new key for programming (see Owner's Guide for more details)
There are billions of possible codes
Auto lamp System
Provides ambient-light-sensitive automatic on-off control of the exterior lights normally controlled by the head lamp control switch
Comes preprogrammed to keep the lights on for approximately 20 seconds after the ignition switch is turned off
If desired, the time delay can be reprogrammed on some vehicles to keep the lights on for up to 3 minutes after the ignition is turned off. See the vehicle Owner‚Äôs Guide for more details
Auto lock
Auto lock feature will lock all the doors, lift gate and lift gate window when all doors are closed, the ignition is in the ON position, the vehicle is shifted into any drive gear putting the vehicle in motion
See the vehicle Owner‚Äôs Guide for vehicle-specific information on the range of functions
Auxiliary Springs
Used on many light trucks for load stability or to support heavy loads with minimal effect on ride characteristics
Help control roll and sway of trucks with high bodies that carry loads that might shift when cornering or operating on high-crowned roads
Usually used on rear leaf springs, and are mounted to act only after the regular springs are partially deflected under heavy loads
Axle Ratio
The number of output shaft (on front-wheel-drive vehicles) or drive shaft (on rear-wheel-drive vehicles) revolutions required to rotate the axle one full turn
For a rear-wheel-drive vehicle with an axle ratio of 3.55:1, the drive shaft would have to rotate 3.55 times to rotate the rear axle once. This is also known as the Final Drive Ratio
Lower numeric axle ratios tend to be more fuel-efficient. Higher axle ratios deliver added torque for increased power for acceleration and trailer towing
Front-wheel-drive vehicles employ an Axle Transfer Ratio, essentially a Final Drive Ratio
Axle, 2-speed
Type of rear drive axle offering two reduction ratios and a control mechanism for selecting either ratio at the driver‚Äôs discretion
"Lo" axle range (the higher numerical ratio) provides maximum pulling power
"Hi" range (the lower numerical ratio) provides maximum road speed
2-speed rear axle permits split-shifting in the lower transmission gears to obtain evenly spaced gear steps that optimize available engine power
2-speed axle can be used in Lo range for crisp performance at slower speeds or in Hi range for maximum economy on the highway
Axles, Rear Drive
Full-floating Rear Axle ‚Äî Generally used in heavier-duty applications. The full-floating axle shafts ‚Äúfloat‚Äù within the outer axle housing where they drive the wheels. The outer housing supports the entire rear weight through double-opposed wheel bearings, which absorb all load and wheel stress
Semi-floating Rear Axle ‚Äî The axle shafts and wheel bearings not only support the total weight, but also transmit driving torque to the wheels. This axle system also resists stress due to skidding, turning corners and other traction forces
See Live Axle for more information

Balance Shaft
Engine shaft designed so it rotates in a way that reduces or cancels out vibrations produced by the engine, resulting in reduced noise, vibration and harshness (NVH) in the passenger compartment
In 4-cylinder engines, two shafts turning in opposite directions on either side of the engine‚Äôs crankshaft are generally used, while in V-type engines, a single balance shaft is used
Battery Saver
Feature on some vehicles that automatically turns off interior or under hood lights after a set period of time (e.g., 30‚Äì45 minutes), to help prevent battery power drainage and save enough power to restart the vehicle.
Bio-foam Seat Materials
Type of foam used in Mustang and Escape/Escape Hybrid seat production
Production of bio-foam is designed to emit less carbon dioxide into the atmosphere
Material is designed to require less energy to produce than the petroleum-based foam
Emphasizes Ford‚Äôs commitment to its environmental responsibility
Body-on-frame Construction
Type of vehicle construction with the body attached to a separate frame, often with rubber mounts to reduce squeaks and rattles, helping to isolate road noise and vibration
Typically more sturdy and robust when compared to vehicles with unibody construction
Provides a solid foundation that contributes to payload and towing capability
Bore and Stroke
While these two terms are frequently used together, they are two totally different measurements
Bore is the measurement of the inside diameter of a cylinder
Stroke is the distance the piston travels from top-dead-center (TDC) to bottom-dead-center (BDC) of the cylinder
Box Side Steps
Frame-mounted steps located on each side of the truck cargo box and in front of the rear wheel well used to make it easy to access the cargo box. Able to support up to 500 lbs.
Allow convenient side access to the cargo box using a release lever located on the step
Return to stowage position by pushing the steps back into/under the cargo box
Boxed Frame
As the name implies, a "boxed" frame has four sides, which provides additional strength. It is a closed structural section that has greater resistance to twisting and torsion forces than comparably sized "open" frame designs.
Brake Bias
Front/rear distribution of a vehicle‚Äôs braking power. Generally the front of a vehicle where the engine and majority of weight and steering functions are located supplies the greater amount of braking power.
Brake Modulation
The process of varying pedal pressure to hold a vehicle on the verge of lockup to supply maximum braking efficiency. Anti-lock Braking Systems (ABS) employ computer-controlled modulators to maximize braking efficiency.
Brake/Shift Interlock (Automatic Transmissions)
Requires driver to depress the brake pedal in order to shift out of Park and into any gear
Prevents accidental engagement of drive gears
Vehicles with a floor-mounted gearshift lever include a manual override in the console; vehicles with a column-mounted gearshift include a manual override under the steering column
Braking Systems
Ford Motor Company uses a number of different braking systems on its passenger cars, crossovers, SUVs and light trucks, including the following: Four-wheel Anti-lock Braking System (ABS)
Helps provide straight, more controlled stops, while helping the driver maintain steering control undermost road conditions, including slippery road surfaces
ABS computer-controlled sensors prevent wheels from locking up, even when the driver presses hard on the brake pedal
Sensors continuously monitor the speed of each wheel. When impending wheel lockup is detected, the computer signals the hydraulic control unit to apply and release (automatically ‚Äúpumping‚Äù) the brakes several times per second with split-second timing, providing a level of braking efficiency that even professional race car drivers cannot duplicate and resulting in shorter stopping distances and greater braking and steering control
Three-channel ABS
Uses three individual channels to monitor and control brake pressure to the front wheels individually and to both rear wheels together
Four-channel ABS
Operates similarly to the three-channel system, except that both rear wheels are monitored and operated separately
ABS Functionality
Computer continuously monitors the ABS for malfunctions. Should a problem develop, an instrument panel light alerts the driver that the ABS computer has shut down and the brakes have been returned to normal, non-ABS operation
Driver should never pump the brakes in a vehicle equipped with ABS. This defeats the system and increases stopping distances. For best performance, the driver should apply maximum pedal pressure
When using ABS, the driver may feel a slight pulsing sensation; this is completely normal
Dual Diagonal Braking System
All Ford vehicles feature either a diagonal or front-rear split hydraulic brake system with warning lamp (excluding F-650/F-750 with air brakes)
With this system, diagonal circuits link front and rear wheels at opposite corners, so braking capacity is retained even if one of the two circuits malfunctions
Power-assisted Four-wheel Disc Brakes
Four-wheel disc brakes consist of a disc at each wheel that rotates at wheel speed and is straddled by a caliper that squeezes the inner and outer faces of the disc to provide stopping or braking power
Disc brakes provide a more linear response, and therefore operate more efficiently at high temperatures than drum brakes
Power-assisted disc brakes use a vacuum-assist to provide power to the master cylinder, thereby greatly reducing pedal effort
Ford power-assisted disc brakes are self-adjusting with pad clearance automatically maintained by the limited retracting action of the piston in the caliper Power-assisted Front Disc/Rear Drum Brakes Combination of the front disc and rear drum brake system. Drum brakes are a type of brake that has an iron casting shaped like a shallow drum that rotates with the wheel. Curved brake shoes are forced into contact with the inner face of the drum to provide stopping or braking power. Power-assisted drum brakes use a vacuum-assist to provide power to the master cylinder, thereby greatly reducing pedal effort. Features of this system include:
Front disc brake pad clearance automatically maintained by the limited retracting action of the piston in the caliper
Adjustment of the rear drum brakes is accomplished when the brake pedal is applied while the vehicle is moving in Reverse
Both front and rear brakes are self-adjusting
Note: Availability of braking systems varies according to model. Refer to the individual vehicle sections of the 2009Source Books or to the Ordering Guide for specific availability.

These flaps are specially shaped to speed up the intake charge at low engine speed and induce a tumble effecting the combustion chamber that results in a more thorough fuel/air mixture and quicker, more efficient burn
At higher engine speed the flaps are completely open and do not affect the intake charge
Chassis
Portion of the vehicle that includes:
Suspension
Steering components
Power train
Brakes
Fuel system Refer to the Power trains section of this book for details concerning Ford power train systems.
Chassis Cab
Unfinished truck featuring an occupant compartment, or cab, without a cargo bed

Climate-controlled Seats
Feature a tiny thermoelectric device that allows the occupant to cool or warm the seat and backrest depending on outdoor temperature and personal preference
The thermoelectric modules are solid-state devices with surfaces that turn hot or cold depending on the polarity of the applied direct current electricity
Heat-transfer components attached to the modules cool or heat the air that is blown past them and then is circulated through ducts and pads in the seats and onto the occupants
Each seat has individual electronic controls to adjust the level of cooling or heating desired
Clutch
Mechanical device that engages and disengages the engine from the transmission/Trans axle during shifting, operated by a pedal to the left of the brake pedal

Command Seating TM
Front-seat design that is raised higher when compared to a typical seat design
Gives the driver and front passenger a "commanding" seating position for comfort and excellent visibility and helps provide drivers a better view of the road due to the raised seat design
This is achieved partly by raising the seat's hip pivot point
Makes getting into and out of the seats easier
Compression Ratio
Ratio between the engine cylinder volume (including the cylinder head volume) when the piston is at the bottom of its stroke and the engine cylinder volume when the piston is at the top of its stroke.
Connecting Rod
Mechanical link between the piston and the crankshaft that enables the piston‚Äôs up-and-down travel to be converted into the crankshaft's rotational motion
Some Ford engines use forged, powdered-metal, cracked connecting rods. These connecting rods are manufactured using a process pioneered by Ford
Connecting rods are typically forged from a flat or round metal billet. Powdered-metal rods, however, begin as loose metal powder blended to the required composition and forged in a form that is nearly at the final "net shape"
Constant Velocity (CV) Joint (Front-wheel-drive Vehicles)
Refined version of a universal joint, typically used on front-wheel-drive vehicles or rear independent suspensions of rear-wheel-drive vehicles to help reduce vibrations inherent in normal universal joints
The CV joint ‚Äî or double universal joint ‚Äî cancels out vibrations caused by the transfer of driving power to the wheels

Cowl
Horizontal portion of the vehicle body behind the engine and immediately to the rear of the hood and under the windshield.
Crankshaft
Primary shaft in the engine that converts the up-and-down motion of the pistons into rotary motion
Crankshaft forces the pistons, via the connecting rods, upward to compress the air/fuel mixture prior to combustion. The combustion of the fuel then forces the piston downward, causing the crankshaft to rotate
Crankshaft is connected to the flywheel and clutch or torque converter flex plate, which transmits power to the transmission
Cross member

Electric rear-window defroster features a silver-filled ceramic heating grid silk-screened on the inside of the glass and includes an instrument panel indicator light and a timer for automatic shutoff
Lines in the heating grid are widely spaced so they do not interfere with rear vision
Detonation
Also known as engine knocking or pre-ignition
Detonation is caused by ignition of the air/fuel mixture in the combustion chamber independent of the spark plug firing
This condition is an engine malfunction and can often be eliminated by a regular tune-up or use of proper grade fuel
See Knock Sensor for more information
Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF)
Located in the exhaust system after the diesel oxidation catalyst
"Scrubs" the particulates in the exhaust gases by trapping them after they have left the combustion chamber
Periodically cleans itself through a process known as "regeneration" which is a process similar to a small incinerator that burns off the trapped particles
Passive generation burns off soot naturally when exhaust temperatures are high enough
Active regeneration (forced burn-off) occurs as needed depending on operational use
Differential
System of gears in the final drive assembly of a vehicle to transmit torque to the driving wheels regardless of whether the vehicle is moving straight ahead or turning a corner
Differential allows the wheels to turn at different speeds while delivering equal torque
When cornering, the driving wheel on the inside of the turn travels in a smaller radius than the outside wheel to prevent the outside wheel from dragging in the turn
Displacement, Engine
Engine displacement is the measure of the total cylindrical volume through which the pistons of an engine move from one end of the stroke to the other. The formula to determine the displacement of an engine is: Displacement = .7854 x Bore x Bore x Stroke x Number of Cylinders. For example: The displacement of the 4.6L V8 engine is: 280.3 (0.7854 x 3.55 x 3.55 x 3.54 x 8).
Dive

Names of at least two of the countries (if any) providing15 percent or more (by value) of all components
City and country of final assembly
The country of origin of the engine and transmission/transaxle
Drag Coefficient (Cd)
Measure of a vehicle's efficiency as an aerodynamic shape, useful for comparison with other vehicle designs
A mathematical factor that, when multiplied by the projected square footage area of the vehicle, gives its drag force in pounds
Cd is derived by measuring the drag force and dividing it by the product of dynamic pressure and vehicle frontal area
Drag coefficient (Cd) = force/dynamic pressure x frontal area; the lower the Cd number, the better the aerodynamic efficiency
Drive line

E85 Vehicles
E85 vehicles are also called Flexible Fuel Vehicles (FFV) due to their ability to operate on a blend of85 percent ethanol fuel and 15 percent unleaded gasoline
Ethanol is derived primarily from corn but can be made from virtually any starch feed stock such as sugarcane, wheat or barley. Because it is produced from crops, it is a renewable fuel and reduces dependence on imported oil
Current Ford vehicles with FFV capability are: Focus ‚Äì 2.0L I4, Explorer ‚Äì 3.5L V6, Taurus ‚Äì 3.5L V6, F-150 ‚Äì 3.7L V6, 5.0L V8, Expedition - 5.4L V8, Navigator - 5.4L V8, E-Series ‚Äì 4.6L V8, 5.4L V8, Super Duty Pickup and Chassis Cab ‚Äì 6.2L V8
See Flexible Fuel Vehicle (FFV)

Emphasizes Ford‚Äôs commitment to its environmental responsibility
Electronic Automatic Temperature Control (EATC)
A climate control system that automatically maintains a specified cabin temperature using either air conditioning or heat. The system automatically sets the blower speed and displays desired temperature set points. It offers manual controls to override automatic settings when necessary.
Electronic Brake Force Distribution (EBD)
Automatically optimizes the front-to-rear brake force distribution to reduce the tendency of rear wheel lockup, especially when the vehicle is unloaded. Effective in braking conditions before ABS operates, EBD also eliminates the need for a hydraulic brake-proportioning valve.
Electronic Fuel Injection (EFI)
A modern, efficient method of fuel delivery that replaced carburetors in all Ford passenger cars and light trucks with gasoline engines
EFI precisely controls the amount of fuel used and improves the dispersion of fuel in the air charge, improving drive ability, fuel economy and performance of the engine
Variations of EFI used in Ford vehicles include: Multi-port Electronic Fuel Injection (MEFI)Also known as ‚Äúdirect port‚Äù injection, MEFI uses individual port-mounted injectors to deliver fuel directly to the intake inlet for each cylinder. This more even distribution of fuel improves power balance between the cylinders, maximizes combustion efficiency and improves drive ability and performance. The system ‚Äúsquirts‚Äù fuel into each cylinder with every revolution of the crankshaft. Sequential Multi-port Electronic Fuel Injection (SEFI)Specific type of multi-port injection that delivers fuel in more precisely timed pulses corresponding to the opening of each intake valve, SEFI takes advantage of the atomized fuel spray from the injectors to achieve a more precise combustion for better performance, often with improved fuel economy.
Electronic Ignition
Ford Motor Company designed-and-built electronic ignition is standard on all domestic gasoline engines. The system is either an:
Electronic Ignition (EI) System, or
Integrated Electronic Ignition (EI) System ‚Äî coil-on-plug (COP)
Electronic Throttle Control (ETC)
Also known as "Drive-by-Wire."
ETC translates accelerator motions and other inputs into control of engine power
The accelerator pedal controls the throttle by means of a computer-controlled stepping motor in lieu of a conventional linkage from pedal to throttle
It works by integrating throttle movements with the vehicle‚Äôs electronically controlled functions such as cruise control or idle speed
Enhances control, drive ability and performance
Emissions Standards
All vehicles sold by an auto maker must meet a U.S. EPA Federal fleet average of Tier 2 Bin 5. Each California Emissions State must meet a different fleet average
California uses the Low Emissions Vehicle grading system while EPA has chosen to categorize emissions standards into a "Tier and Bin" system
Energy-absorbing Steering Column
In all passenger cars and light trucks sold in the U.S., energy-absorbing steering columns are designed to collapse in the event of occupant contact in a frontal collision, reducing the potential head and chest injuries to the driver.
Engine Exhaust Brake
System added to a diesel engine that allows the driver to energize an engine-derived vehicle retardation system. Some engine brakes use compression pressures while the most common are those that employ engine exhaust. In either case, the principle is to let the engine help retard the vehicle speed, thus saving on wheel brake wear.
Engines ‚Äî Diesel
Ford diesel engines provide certain advantages for some applications, including many truck applications. Diesel engines use no spark plugs, require a lower rpm range to produce peak power (especially torque) output and produce higher torque than horsepower for optimized towing performance. Additionally, diesel engines deliver more efficient fuel economy than gasoline engines and maximize fuel efficiency at idle, making them ideal for tasks requiring prolonged idle time. In a diesel engine:
Diesel fuel is compressed until it reaches a temperature hot enough for combustion
Glow plugs are used to preheat the air in the cylinders and to ensure easy starting on cold days
Heavier-weight components are used in some areas to handle the higher compression ratio ‚Äî generally more than twice that of gasoline engines
Engines ‚Äî Gasoline
There are two types of piston configurations available on Ford passenger cars and light trucks: In-line (I-4) and V-type (V6, V8 or V10).In-line engine ‚Äî has all of the cylinders in a single line with the pistons moving vertically in the cylinders.
Pairs of pistons are located 180 degrees of crankshaft revolution from one another in an in-line 4-cylinder engine
V-angle engine ‚Äî has cylinder banks formed in a V-type engine design, measured in degrees.
A 60-degree V6 is narrow by design and has excellent natural balance characteristics
Engine vibration is reduced as the number of cylinders is increased, whatever the V-angle, because the impulse of each cylinder firing occurs more frequently
EPA Fuel Economy Ratings
Fuel economy is measured under controlled conditions in a laboratory using a standardized test procedure specified by federal law and implemented by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Manufacturers test their own vehicles‚Äî usually preproduction prototypes ‚Äîand report the results to the EPA. The EPA reviews the results and confirms about 10‚Äì15 percent of them through their own tests at the National Vehicles and Fuel Emissions Laboratory. Vehicle is driven on a roller dynamometer (the vehicle remains stationary while the driven wheels are allowed to roll) and a hose is connected to the tailpipe to collect engine exhaust. The carbon in the exhaust is measured to calculate the amount of fuel burned during the test. This is more accurate than using calculations based on distance traveled and the amount of fuel consumed. Five separate test schedules are driven to simulate the driving conditions of city, highway, and hot weather with air conditioning on, high-speed driving and acceleration, and cold weather environments. The latter three tests are new for 2008 model year vehicles and will likely result in a decrease in mpg versus the same model tested under the pre-2008 test procedure. Driving cycles: City ‚Äî 23 stops with accelerations to 20‚Äì60 mph. Highway ‚Äî approximately 13 minutes of mixed rural and interstate driving with speeds ranging from30 to 60 mph. High Speed ‚Äî aggressive accelerations to speeds of up to 80 mph with six minutes of driving 60‚Äì80 mph. Air Conditioning ‚Äî 10 minutes of accelerations to varying speeds up to 60 mph with the air conditioning on while the vehicle is in an environment of 95 degrees and approximately 40 percent relative humidity. Cold ‚Äî represents urban driving in 20-degree weather. The vehicle is started with the engine cold and driven in simulated stop-and-go rush hour traffic.

Front-wheel Drive (FWD)
Drive configuration in which the engine power is supplied to the front wheels via half shafts.
Frontal Area
Frontal area of a vehicle can be a contributing factor when determining the size of trailer a vehicle can tow
Larger frontal area will add drag, thus reducing the vehicle‚Äôs ability to tow a trailer
For many vehicles, frontal area restrictions limit a trailer's size to a specific Gross Combined Weight Rating (GCWR)
The frontal area is also a determining factor in selecting an incomplete vehicle that complies with emissions requirements
Fuel Pump Inertia Shutoff Switch
Impact-activated switch, standard on all Ford cars and trucks, that automatically shuts off the fuel being pumped to the engine, for added safety in the event of a collision. Once the inertia-type switch is triggered, it must be reset manually. Refer to the specific vehicle‚Äôs Owner‚Äôs Guide for details on resetting the switch.

Galvanizing
Coating of steel with zinc to help form a rust-preventive surface.
GAWR (Gross Axle Weight Rating)
Weight specified by the vehicle manufacturer as the load-carrying capacity of a single-axle system, front or rear. The GAWR is limited by the lowest individual rating of tires, wheels, springs or the axle itself.
GCWR (Gross Combination Weight Rating)
Weight specified by the manufacturer as the maximum loaded weight of a towing vehicle and its trailer. The sum of the loaded vehicle weight of the truck and trailer should not exceed the GCWR.GCWR = vehicle curb weight + payload + trailer weight + driver and passengers
Glad Hand
Quick-release couplings, attached to the tractor cab, that connect the tractor brake hoses to the trailer
These couplings open the supply line when twisted together and close the line when twisted apart to prevent the loss of air pressure
Glass, Solar-tinted
Automotive window glass with construction that helps prevent ultraviolet ray penetration of the passenger compartment
Solar-tinted glass helps reduce heat buildup in the interior of the vehicle by blocking out a significant portion of the solar energy. It accomplishes this not by reflecting the rays, but by absorbing the radiation and reradiating the majority of it to the exterior of the vehicle
Grade ability
Grade-climbing ability is the percent of grade a vehicle will climb with a given load
A 1 percent grade is equivalent to a rise of 1 foot in a horizontal distance of 100 feet; a 2 percent grade is a2-foot rise in a horizontal distance of 100 feet, etc.
Grade-climbing ability will affect a vehicle‚Äôs performance and should be considered when determining payload or trailer towing requirements
On steeper grades, a vehicle will be under more stress to handle these heavy requirements
GVVW (Gross Vehicle Weight)

Recommended between -10¬∞F and -20¬∞F
Strongly recommended below -20¬∞F
Height-Adjustable Safety Belt
Multiple-position front-seat shoulder safety belt anchor that is height adjustable to allow a comfortable and proper fit of the outboard safety belts.
High-Intensity Discharge (HID) Head lamps
HID lighting systems use a special quartz bulb with no filament
Bulb is filled primarily with xenon gas along with a small amount of mercury and other metal salts
Bulb features two electrodes separated by a small gap (about 4mm or 3/16th inch). When high voltage current is applied to the electrodes, it excites the gases inside the bulb and forms an electrical arc between the electrodes
Hot ionized gas produces a "plasma discharge" which generates an intense, bluish-white light
Because there is no brittle filament inside a xenon HID bulb to break or burn out, the head lamps typically last up to three times longer than halogen head lamps (3000 hours versus 1000 hours of continuous operation, which is equivalent to 5 to 10 years of normal driving)
Horsepower
Amount of power needed to lift a 550-lb. object at a rate of one foot in one second
Horsepower is expressed as the torque in lb.-ft. times the number of revolutions per minute divided by the constant 5252:
Gross horsepower is obtained by a dynamometer test of an engine equipped only with the built-in accessories essential to its operation, such as fuel pump, oil pump, coolant pump and built-in emissions-control equipment
Net horsepower is obtained by a dynamometer test of a complete engine equipped with all the accessories necessary to perform its intended functions unaided, including the air-intake system, exhaust system, cooling system, generator, starter and emissions-control equipment
Torque is what gets a vehicle moving, and horsepower is the force required to keep a vehicle moving once torque has started the vehicle moving from a standstill

Intake Port
Passageway in the cylinder head leading from the intake manifold to the intake valve(s).
Integrated Trailer Brake Controller
Electronic or electro hydraulic device installed in a tow vehicle used to activate the braking system of the trailer being towed. Controller uses actual braking pressure of the tow vehicle to calculate how much braking force to apply to the trailer. Most after market add-on controllers use a timer or proportional load basis to calculate the amount of brake force required. Since the Ford trailer brake controller is fully integrated into the truck‚Äôs onboard computer, this is the first and only controller able to adapt its output based on the status of the Anti-lock Braking System (ABS) to help provide more controlled, stable stops. Trailer brake controller is also fully integrated into the instrument panel design for the convenience of the driver during hookup and operation.
Integrated Wheel End (IWE) System
Provides Expedition with an outstanding four-wheel-drive system. The system is vacuum operated. In two-wheel-drive mode, a vacuum is applied to withdraw the clutch ring from the wheel hub coupler, completely separating the axle shaft from the wheel end. This avoids "back driving" the axle shafts, resulting in less wear and drag and slightly improved fuel economy. In four-wheel-drive mode the vacuum is shut off, the clutch ring engages the wheel hub coupler, and the axle shaft and hub are locked together to provide the necessary additional traction.
Inter cooler
Used on supercharged and turbo charged vehicles, the inter cooler is mounted at the front of the vehicle in the air stream and cools the compressed intake air as it flows over fins and plates inside the inter cooler. The inter cooler removes heat (produced by supercharging/turbo charging) from the compressed air before it enters the engine's intake system. This action generates a denser, cooler intake charge and increases the engine‚Äôs ability to produce horsepower and torque. Inter cooling also increases the detonation threshold of the engine because of the cooler air charge, meaning the engine can be run with more ignition advance for higher performance, or run lower octane fuel before experiencing detonation. The cooler intake air also allows the engine to run slightly cooler, reducing the chance of overheating.
Inter cooling
System for cooling pressurized intake air to obtain improved combustion efficiency and fuel economy
The cooling process increases the density of the intake charge, promoting more thorough combustion with reduced emissions

Lockup Torque Converter
Because the automatic transmission is linked to the engine by a fluid coupling, rather than by the mechanical clutch of a manual transmission, there is a potential loss of efficiency due to slippage. The lockup torque converter improves fuel economy by eliminating this slippage. An internal clutch system provides a positive, direct connection between the engine and transmission. It is usually controlled by the power train computer and will operate only after the vehicle has moved away from a stop or shifted out of low gear.

Octane Rating
Octane is the measure of gasoline‚Äôs ability to resist auto-ignition, which can cause engine knock
Two laboratory test methods measure gasoline octane value
Research Octane Number (RON)
Motor Octane Number (MON)
RON correlated best with low-speed, mild engine knocking conditions
MON correlates with high-temperature engine knocking conditions with part-throttle operation
North America typically uses the Anti-Knock Index of (RON + MON)/2 to specify octane rating
Vehicles are designed and calibrated to a certain octane value
When a customer uses gasoline with an octane level lower than specified, engine knock may result and could lead to service engine damage

Partial Zero Emissions Vehicle (PZEV)
120,000 miles of driving. By comparison, a vehicle certified to the Federal Tier 2 Bin 5 California LEV II emissions standards currently in effect emits about 29 pounds over the same 120,000 miles. To achieve a PZEV rating, a vehicle must meet certain criteria, including:
Meet the Super Ultra Low Emissions Vehicle (SULEV II) standards for tailpipe pollution
Demonstrate zero fuel-based evaporative emissions
The manufacturer‚Äôs warranty must ensure that emissions-related components are covered for 15 years or 150,000 miles, whichever comes first(1)
Payload
Weight of the actual cargo and occupant(s) carried by a vehicle
Payload capacities are computed by subtracting the curb weight of the vehicle from its specified Gross Vehicle Weight Rating (GVWR)
Addition of any optional equipment or passengers adds to the vehicle weight and subtracts from the allowable payload
Trucks with a GVWR of Class 6 or higher calculate payload by simply subtracting the weight of the completed vehicle from the GVWR to determine payload
Pillars
Pillars are the vertical beams that support the roof and separate passenger compartment windows. A-pillar ‚Äî First, or most forward, roof support pillar located on either side of the windshield. Also known as "windshield pillar" or "A-post" B-pillar ‚Äî Center roof support that divides the front and rear doors on 4-door and passenger wagon models. On2-door models, the B-pillar separates the door and rear quarter window/panel. On vans and passenger wagons, the B-pillar is behind the front doors C-pillar ‚Äî Rear roof supporting member on most vehicles. On CUVs/SUVs, this pillar separates the rear doors and quarter panel glass D-pillar ‚Äî Vertical, or sometimes diagonal, roof support member at the extreme rear of the roof or greenhouse structure on mini vans, CUVs/SUVs and some sedan body styles

Pound-Feet
Unit of measure for engine torque commonly abbreviated as lb.-ft. The commonly used term of ‚Äúfoot-pounds‚Äù is more properly a measurement of work rather than torque.
Power Adjustable Brake and Accelerator Pedals
Power adjustable pedals allow for the forward or rearward adjustment (up to 3 inches) of the accelerator and brake pedals through the activation of an instrument-panel-mounted switch. This is an especially useful feature for drivers of smaller stature, allowing them to comfortably reach the pedals while being able to maintain the required distance from the steering-wheel-mounted airbag. This feature can be packaged together with an available seat position memory system on certain vehicles for the ultimate in comfort and convenience.
Power Band
Rpm range over which an engine delivers a substantial portion of its peak power. The power band generally extends from slightly below the engine‚Äôs torque peak to slightly above its power peak.
Power Takeoff (PTO)
Power takeoff refers to using the vehicle‚Äôs power train as a power source to perform some work other than moving the vehicle. Examples of this work include operating auxiliary equipment such as a wrecker and snowplow lifts, dump bodies, hydraulic/pneumatic tools and so on. The PTO unit is located between the power train and the device it powers. When a vehicle is doing this work while it is not moving, keep in mind that it is also deprived of the cooling benefits airflow provides. Because of this, it is important not to block the front grille or bumper openings. Specific precautions are listed in the Body Builders Layout Book. While Ford does not offer the actual PTO units, Ford F-Series Super Duty¬Æ engineers worked closely with two PTO after market suppliers (Parker Chelsea and Muncie) during development of the truck. This work helped create two different Ford-specific after market units that bolt directly onto the transmission‚Äôs power takeoff interface (the interface is standard on F-Series Super Duty models equipped with a manual transmission, optional with automatic transmission).
Power Takeoff (PTO) Provision
Power Takeoff (PTO) Provision is an added benefit for customers with specific auxiliary power needs. It enables up fitters to supply auxiliary power to hydraulically driven accessories such as dump bodies, sprayers, pumps, generators, etc. Front-mounted, front-powered equipment is often powered by a direct drive shaft from the front of the engine. The adaptation of the vehicle to allow this installation is called the Power Takeoff Provision. This includes an adapter plate on the engine, and in some instances clearance through the grille or front-end sheet metal. An optional front frame extension for mounting equipment is available on all models except the Pro Loader. The F-650 and F-750extensions are bolted on, while the F-750S extension has an integral extension of the frame rail.
Transmission Power Takeoff Provision‚Äì A specific option code must be ordered to get a PTO gear and port with the TorqShift¬Æ 5-speed automatic transmission
85P for E-Series Van/Cutaway
62R for F-Series Super Duty¬Æ
44B for LCF‚Äì The 6-speed manual overdrive transmission has a PTO gear and a port standard (NA on E-Series and LCF)
Stationary Elevated Idle Control (SEIC)‚Äì This standard feature in all E-350/E-450, F-250/F-350/F-450/F-550 and Ford LCF models provides the "throttle-kicker," replacing the Auxiliary Idle Control Kit in prior model years. It consists of a strategy embedded in the power train control module (PCM), and a set of blunt-cut wires to command it‚Äì The selling dealer will need to obtain the customer interface (e.g., PTO controller or switch) from the aftermarket NOTE: "Up fitter Switches,"(Standard on F-350/F-450/F-550 Chassis Cabs, option code 66Son F-250/F-350 Pickups) may be used as a PTO switch. SEIC provides engine speeds of 910 to 2400 rpm for 5.4L and 6.8L gas engines, and 1200 to 2400 rpm for all (4.5L, 6.0L and 6.4L) diesel engines. It also automatically locks the torque converter providing power to the PTO gear for the TorqShift automatic transmission when the operator turns on the PTO switch. Instructions to up fitters for completing the SEIC/PTO circuitry are detailed in the 2008 Model Year Light Truck Body Builders Layout Book, found at www.fleet.ford.com/truckbbas. Refer to the latest Dealer Ordering Guide for model and engine restrictions.
Power train
Name given to the combination of engine, transmission/transaxle and differential (rear-wheel drive only) for any particular model. See the Power trains section of this book for details concerning Ford power train systems.
Power train Control Module (PCM) with On-Board Diagnostics (OBD II)
PCM with OBD II was developed to accommodate the goals of achieving mandated emissions control and improving vehicle performance
The latest PCM incorporates more functions, more memory and more new integrated circuits than the former control system, helping it be more precise than its predecessors PCM features and benefits:
Potential improvements in:‚Äì Performance‚Äì Drive ability‚Äì Fuel economy‚Äì Emissions control
Through state-of-the-art technologies, Ford Service Technicians are able to fully reprogram the PCM memory by electronically ‚Äútalking‚Äù to a single connector on the vehicle, allowing the module to receive upgrades rather than requiring replacement
PCM system enables Ford vehicles to comply with the latest California Air Resources Board (CARB) OBD II requirements designed to help maintain vehicle emissions control. As more stringent emissions regulations are adopted in the future, the PCM will be able to adapt to these as well PCM enables Ford to meet OBD II requirements by monitoring:
Catalyst efficiency
Fuel system
Evaporative emissions
Exhaust gas recirculation
Other emissions-related control systems as well as various sensors and actuators The PCM also helps improve accuracy during repair procedures. The PCM‚Äôs enhanced capability expands the ability of Ford Service Technicians to trace problems, even intermittent problems, quickly and easily.
Through the use of diagnostic scan tools, Technicians also are able to retrieve recorded vehicle performance history from PCM, leading to quicker and more accurate diagnoses
Power-to-weight Ratio
Although power-to-weight ratios may be configured in many ways, they are generally the proportion of the vehicle's curb weight divided by the vehicle‚Äôs horsepower measured at peak rpm. A vehicle that produces more horsepower or torque than another vehicle of equal weight will have a greater power-to-weight ratio.
PSI
Pounds per square inch ‚Äî the measurement of pressure that results from a specified amount of gas in a limited volume. For example, the more air that is put into a tire, the greater the psi

Rack-and-pinion Steering
See Steering Systems.
Radiator
Component of the engine cooling system that stores coolant and consists of a series of tubes that allow air to pass through, dissipating excess heat.
The coolant circulates through the engine to help reduce engine heat
Fresh air is drawn through the radiator to remove heat from the engine coolant
Rear View Camera
Camera located in the rear of the vehicle
Automatically engages when the vehicle is placed in Reverse
Displays within the electro chromic auto-dimming rearview mirror or on the Navigation Screen, depending upon the vehicle
Vehicle centerline, rear bumper orientation, and green/red/yellow trajectory lines are shown within the display, helping the driver to assess the vehicle‚Äôs proximity to surrounding objects in the rear
Rear-wheel Drive
Drive configuration where the engine power is supplied to the rear wheels via a drive shaft and rear differential assembly.
Redline
Maximum recommended engine revolutions per minute (rpm). A tachometer, standard or available on some models, displays a red area to alert the driver that the engine speed is beyond the recommended rate.
Resisting Bending Moment (RBM)
Result of multiplying yield strength and section modulus when comparing frames of the same material, the one with the largest section modulus will be the strongest. When comparing frames of different materials, the frame with the highest RBM has the greater strength.
Reverse Sensing System (Reverse Vehicle Aid Sensor)
Helps audibly alert drivers of certain objects close to the rear of the vehicle (within approximately 6 feet) as the driver backs the vehicle up slowly. As the vehicle approaches an object, a warning tone beeps. The beeps increase in frequency as the vehicle gets closer to the object, until it becomes a continuous tone at less than approximately 10 inches from the object
System activates automatically when the vehicle is shifted into Reverse. Pressing a switch on the instrument panel will turn the system off. An "Off" light on the switch illuminates to indicate the system is not active. The system reactivates when the vehicle is again placed in Reverse
Reverse Sensing System (Reverse Vehicle Aid Sensor) cont'd
Customer Benefits
Helps make getting in and out of tight parking spaces easier. The system:
Detects what the driver may not see, such as other vehicles, fences, walls, concrete posts, plant containers ,fire hydrants and the like
Enables drivers to use better judgment in tight parking situations
Provides information to drivers to help reduce damage from hitting objects at low speeds (90 percent of backup collisions are at speeds less than 5 mph)
How It Works
Four ultrasonic sensors in the vehicle‚Äôs rear bumper transmit signals
When the signals contact an object, they bounce back to the sensors on the vehicle
Within milliseconds, the system calculates the distance to the object, based on the time it took the signal to travel from the object back to the sensor
If the distance is within approximately 6 feet, the alert is sounded
System continues to send out and monitor signals, adjusting the warning beep according to the object‚Äôs distance from the vehicle
Ride Height
Distance between the ground and a specified point on the vehicle body with properly inflated tires. The lowest point of the bumper is generally used as the vehicle measuring point.
Rigid Axle
Simple non-independent suspension consisting of a rigid transverse member with wheel hubs that are solidly bolted to it. The axle can be attached to the vehicle body by leaf springs or by a combination of suspension arms and links. See Hotchkiss-Design Rear Axle.
Ring-and-pinion Gear
Set that uses a small gear (the pinion gear) to turn a larger diameter annular gear (the ring gear).
Road holding
Ability of the vehicle to maintain traction with, or grip, the pavement while cornering.
  Roll
Rotation along an imaginary axis running the length of the vehicle between the driver's-side and passenger's-side wheels. Roll causes the vehicle to tilt or lean left or right. A stabilizer bar can often counteract the effects of roll.
rpm
Revolutions per minute, the number of engine crankshaft rotations completed in one minute. Configured in thousands, a tachometer will report the engine‚Äôs rpm to the driver and help alert the driver as to when proper shifting is required.

Safety Belt Energy Management Retractors
See page 5-10 in the Safety section of this book.
Safety Belts
System of belts or harnesses designed to restrain and help reduce the risk of injury to occupants in the event of side, rear, rollover or frontal collisions. Refer to the Safety section of this book for details concerning Ford safety belt systems.
Safety Cell Construction
Integrated body structure designed to work as a system to provide protection for occupants. Its major design features include:
Front-end structure with a reinforced sub frame to provide energy absorption
Cross cowl beam that helps provide an additional mounting point for the steering column and airbag mountings, reducing their movement in the event of a frontal impact
High-strength side door intrusion beams
Sheet metal at the front and rear corners that collapses progressively and predictably to dissipate some of the energy of an impact
Seats, Hi-back
Back of this individual seat is about as high as the top of the occupant‚Äôs head. It tapers in from shoulder height to form an integral head restraint.
Section Modulus
Measure of the strength of frame side rails determined by the cross-section area and shape of the side rails. When comparing frames of the same material, the one with the largest section modulus will be the strongest. When comparing frames of different materials, the frame with the highest Resisting Bending Moment (RBM) has the greater strength.
Self-adjusting Clutch
Optional self-adjusting clutch, once installed, does not have to be adjusted again. When the release bearing travel exceeds 1/2-inch, the self-adjusting mechanism returns the clutch and pedal free play to normal operating conditions as the clutch pedal is actuated. A self-adjusting clutch eliminates eight to ten clutch adjustments over the life of a clutch.
Sequential Multi-port Electronic Fuel Injection (SEFI)
Specific type of multi-port injection that delivers fuel in more precisely timed pulses corresponding to the opening of each intake valve. SEFI takes advantage of the atomized fuel spray from the injectors to achieve a more precise combustion for better performance, often with improved fuel economy.
Shock Absorber
Provides mechanical or hydraulic friction to control deflection of automobile springs
Oil in the shocks is forced through small passages to absorb the force of a road shock
Pressurized gas is used in many shock absorbers to prevent aeration of the oil. This reduces the tendency of the shock to overheat on rough road surfaces
Short- and Long-Arm (SLA) Suspension
Independent design that allows either wheel to react to road imperfections with minimal effect on the opposite wheel. Several distinct advantages over MacPherson struts include camber control, turning geometry and lower component package height. These advantages permit a lower hood line. Major design features include:
Gas-pressurized shock absorbers to maintain optimum ride control over a variety of road surfaces
Control arms to help absorb braking and acceleration forces
Coil springs or torsion bars (on select vehicles)
Single Overhead Camshaft (SOHC) Design
Engine design with the camshaft located atop the cylinder head, operating both the intake and exhaust valves. SOHC V6 and V8 engines, which are designed with cylinders in two banks, have a total of two cams, one for each cylinder head. The one cam in each head operates the intake and exhaust valves, resulting in improved performance and fuel efficiency. All engines using the overhead cam design offer the potential for greater power output and higher engine speeds (rpm) when compared with overhead valve designs.

Skid plate
Deflector plate under a vehicle that helps provide protection from off-road debris. Transfer case and fuel tank skid plates are common on Ford 4x4 vehicles.
Slack Adjusters (automatic/manual)
All Ford air brake trucks come equipped with automatic slack adjusters
When properly maintained, slack adjusters retain accurate shoe-to-drum clearances (slack)
This promotes even brake wear, reducing brake downtime and expense
Properly adjusted brakes are a plus factor for vehicle safety
Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE)
The organization that sets American automotive standards for automotive measurements, including horsepower, torque and lubricants.
Split-port Induction (SPI)
Most split-port induction systems have a dual-runner engine intake design promoting high-volume/high-velocity airflow to increase engine performance.
Dual-runner design features long, small-diameter runners tuned for low engine rpm torque and short, large-diameter runners tuned for high rpm horsepower
Runner usage is controlled by the electronic engine controls and integral throttle-body valves
SPI engines use a cylinder head with two runners per cylinder. These runners carry the air charge to the intake side of the combustion chamber. At lower engine speeds, the air charge is directed through a narrow pathway that results in a higher air velocity, quickening engine response. As engine speed increases above 3000 rpm, the second path works to further enhance engine power and operating efficiency
Spring Rating
Any one of several methods of describing spring ratings currently used in the light truck industry, including:
Rating at Pad ‚Äî The amount of weight above the pad that can actually be supported by the springs, including the chassis, body and payload weights
Rating at Ground ‚Äî Includes the Rating at Pad plus the weight of components between the spring and ground (axle, brakes, tires and wheels)
Sprung Weight ‚Äî The weight of those components supported by the spring, such as the frame, engine, body, payload, etc.
Unsprung Weight ‚Äî The portion of the weight of the chassis (i.e., axle, wheels, tires, brakes, etc.) not supported by the springs, as well as one-half the weight of the springs and drive shaft
Stabilizer Bar
Bar or tube that provides added support for suspension members to minimize body lean or roll. The stabilizer is transversely mounted and used at the front and/or rear suspension to resist unequal vertical motion across the width of the vehicle.

Stroke
Maximum distance traveled by a piston between bottom-dead-center (BDC) and top-dead-center (TDC). If the stroke is increased, the displacement increases and vice versa.
Strut
Suspension element that uses a reinforced shock absorber as one of the wheel‚Äôs locating members, typically by solidly connecting the wheel hub to the bottom of the strut.
Sub frame
Partial frame that connects the vehicle‚Äôs power train and front suspension or rear components to its underbody.
Sub frame, Isolated
Attaches to the front or rear structure of some Ford vehicles
Provides support for the engine, transmission and often the suspension
Provides added strength and rigidity to the vehicle‚Äôs construction
Uses rubber mounts to reduce levels of noise, vibration and harshness
Supercharger
Supercharger is a large air pump that is normally mounted on the engine intake manifold and belt-driven by the crankshaft
Most superchargers contain two impellers that compress the incoming air charge
Advantage of compressing the intake air is that you allow more air to enter each cylinder. The engine‚Äôs fuel control computer then adds more fuel to compensate for the added air, increasing the power and torque output of the engine
Typical boost provided by a supercharger is 6 to 8 pounds per square inch (psi)

Synchromesh
Synchromesh clutch is typically a drum or sleeve that slides back and forth on a splined output shaft by means of a shifting fork
Generally, it has a bronze cone on each side that engages with a tapered mating cone. When this drum, or sleeve, is moved along the output shaft, the cone acts as a clutch
Upon contacting the gear that is to be engaged, the output shaft is sped up or slowed down as required until the speeds of the output shaft and the gear are synchronized, or are ‚Äúin sync‚Äù with each other
Synchronized Gears
Synchronized gears are used in manual transmissions to facilitate the meshing of two gears by causing the speed of both gears to coincide
This helps move clutch assemblies to the specific chosen gear
A synchronizer will help prevent an improper shift that could damage the transmission, such as shifting into first gear at highway speeds
T
Print
Tachometer
Gauge on the vehicle instrument cluster indicating engine speed measured in crankshaft revolutions per minute (rpm).
Tailgate Step
An integrated steel step and handle that folds down from the top of an open tailgate
Allows an easier step up into the cargo box and stores itself once the tailgate is closed
Tappets, Hydraulic Roller Valve
Also known as valve lifters
A device in the valve system that transmits the action of the cam to the valve or the push rod
Hydraulic lifters are designed to automatically take up the clearance that exists between the valve and the lifter
This is known as valve lash
Theater-style Seating
Also known as ‚Äústadium seating‚Äù

Tire Information
Most Ford car and light truck tires carry a P-metric designation such as P185/70R14 or an LT-metric designation such as LT235/70R16. In the charts below, the alphabetical or metric and load range letters used are obtained from Tire and Rim Association Standard Tables. P-metric Steel-belted Radial-ply Tires All Ford cars and most light trucks have P-metric steel-belted radial-ply tires as standard equipment. They are designed in accordance with nationally accepted dimensional standards. Benefits include:
Improved fuel economy through increased inflation pressure (up to 35 psi; 44 psi for some light trucks)
Lighter weight
Tread compounds designed for reduced rolling resistance LT-metric Steel-belted Radial Tires
LT-metric designates a light truck radial tire with a metric tire designation
Available with both all-season and all-terrain tread patterns for greater versatility
Designed to support larger vehicles and heavier loads Medium-Duty Truck Tires used on Ford medium-duty trucks (F-650/F-750 and Ford LCF) are of a radial-ply design. They fall into several classes of service conditions:
Over-the-road (highway) tires are used on paved surfaces for local and/or long distance runs
Mixed service tires are for use on a variety of surfaces such as pavement, gravel, dirt or other unpaved surfaces
All-position tires have treads that are suitable for general over-the-road operation
Steering axle tires usually feature circumferential grooves that equalize pressure across the tread face
Drive axle tires have deep treads and block-type patterns for extra traction All-season Tires Most Ford vehicles use all-season tires with a wraparound block-type tread design that offers the following benefits:
Increased traction in mud and snow
May be used year-round as standard passenger car or light truck tires Tread compounds and tire construction used with the all-season tires are formulated to convert less energy to heat when flexing compared to previous compounds. This helps reduce rolling resistance compared to previously designed steel-belted radial-ply tires. All-terrain Tires
All-terrain tires are available on several light trucks, primarily on 4x4 models. As their name indicates, all-terrain tires are designed for both on- and off-road use over a variety of surfaces
Generally, they have a deeper, wider tread design than all-season tires for better gripping on a variety of surfaces Aspect Ratio
Measurement of a tire‚Äôs unloaded sidewall height divided by its width
As an example, a tire with an aspect ratio of 75 would have a section height that is 75 percent of the tire's width
Lower aspect ratio reflects a shorter, wider tire that offers greater contact with the road. Dual Spacing Distance between the center lines of both tires on a dual-rear setup. Flotation Tires
Tires with an extra-wide tread width are often referred to as flotation tires
Usual applications are for off-road operation where soft sand, mud, marshy or snowy conditions are typical Offset
On dual wheels, the distance from the center of the rim midway between the flanges to the outer mounting face of the wheel
On single wheels, this is the distance from the center of the rim to the wheel mounting surface Performance Tires, All-season
Performance tires generally have aggressive tread designs and are distinguished by large, solid tread blocks separated by open channels to promote water drainage and prevent hydroplaning
A key benefit of performance tires is optimized steering response and adhesion during acceleration, braking and cornering, usually with some small penalty in ride harshness and tread noise Ply Rating (PR), Load Range (B), Load Index/Speed Designation (97V) or Standard Load Rating (SL or XL)
Ply rating is a standard unit of tire casing strength, based on the strength of cord plies
The term is used to indicate the load-carrying ability of a given tire
It is an index of tire strength and does not necessarily represent the number of cord plies in the tire
Ply rating is indicated as 4PR, 6PR, 8PR, etc.
Load range (B, C, D, etc.) is gradually replacing the term "ply rating"
Load index/speed designation (92T, 97H, 97V, etc.)
P-metric passenger-type tires are offered with a standard load rating (SL ‚Äî up to 35 psi) or extra load rating(XL ‚Äî up to 41 psi)Radial-Ply Tires Type of tire that has one or more rubberized plies of cords running from bead to bead at right angles to the tread and parallel to each other, plus two or more plies of reinforced belts that encircle the tire under the tread. Rim Width Distance between the inside surfaces of the rim flanges. Speed Designations Tires are laboratory wheel-tested at specified load and inflation pressure for the speed designation. R-rated tires are specified for speeds up to and including 106 mph S-rated tires are specified for speeds up to and including 112 mph T-rated tires are specified for speeds up to and including 118 mph H-rated tires are specified for speeds up to and including 130 mph V-rated tires are specified for speeds up to and including 149 mph Z-rated tires are specified for speeds over 149 mph NOTE: Speed designations are for reference only. Actual speed capability of tires may change in vehicle applications. Tire Clearance to Vehicle Distance between the tire sidewall or tread and the nearest part of the vehicle's chassis, suspension or body. Tire Loaded Radius
Distance from the center of the wheel to the road with tire loaded to rated capacity
Static radius applied when vehicle is at rest Tire Revolutions per Mile Term used for the number of times the tire revolves when traveling one mile. Tire Section Width Maximum outer width of an inflated new tire from sidewall to sidewall, exclusive of ribs, bars, decorations, etc. Track Width Lateral distance between the centers of the front or rear tires. Unidirectional Tires Tread pattern designed for rotation in the direction indicated on the sidewall and used in some performance tire designs, e.g., Goodyear Eagle VR60 tires.
Tire Pressure Monitoring System (TPMS)
TPMS uses a tire pressure sensor mounted to a metal band in the wheel‚Äôs drop well
Sensors use radio frequency transmitters to send tire pressure information to the vehicle‚Äôs onboard computer
The computer illuminates a warning light and sounds an audible tone when tire pressure is significantly low
System is completely hidden from sight and uses a standard rubber valve stem
Can be used on steel or aluminum wheels
Replacing the tire can be easily done without removing the sensor
TPMS provides a more accurate tire pressure reading because it measures actual tire pressure as opposed to wheel speed like the Low Tire Warning System
Senses temperature-based pressure loss where all four wheels are affected
Resetting the system is easy. Once cold tire pressure has been restored to its recommended level, TPMS-equipped vehicles simply need to be driven over 20 mph for at least 2 minutes to be reset
Torque
Turning or twisting force that produces rotation, expressed in pound-feet (lb.-ft.)
Torque affects the vehicle‚Äôs performance when accelerating, when carrying heavy loads or when towing a trailer
See Torque Rating How torque is generated in one cylinder of a four-stroke engine
Combustion of gas in the cylinder creates pressure against the piston
That pressure creates a force on the piston that pushes it down
The force is transmitted from the piston to the connecting rod, and from the connecting rod to the crankshaft
The point where the connecting rod attaches to the crankshaft is some distance from the center of the shaft
The horizontal distance changes as the crankshaft spins, so the torque also changes since torque equals force multiplied by distance
Torque Converter
Device in an automatic transmission/transaxle that transforms mechanical power (torque) from the engine into hydro kinetic (fluid) power to the transmission.
Torque converter serves as a hydraulic clutch
Engine is mechanically linked to an impeller, which is made up of a series of blades within a housing filled with transmission fluid
Impeller responds directly to engine speed, which transfers energy to the fluid
Turbine, which consists of a separate series of blades, absorbs this fluidic energy and transmits power to the transmission
This mechanism allows for a smooth transfer of power from the engine to the transmission
Torque Rating
Measure of an engine's power capability whereby the amount of twisting or rotating effort being exerted on the crankshaft is expressed in pound-feet (lb.-ft.) of force. The unit "pound-foot" represents the force of one pound acting at a right angle to the rotating crankshaft at a distance of one foot in length. Torque is what gets the vehicle moving and horsepower is what keeps the vehicle moving.
Torque Steer
Unwanted imbalance of driving force between the front wheels of a front-wheel-drive vehicle that causes the car to pull to the left or right under heavy acceleration
Driver senses torque steer as a turning force at the steering wheel when the vehicle is accelerating from a start. Under normal driving conditions, torque steer is virtually eliminated in Ford vehicles
Torsion Bar
Spring consisting of a long solid or tubular rod with one end fixed to the chassis and the other twisted by a lever connected to the suspension.
Traction Control ‚Äî All-Speed
All-Speed Traction Control uses a combination of brake and/or engine control to maximize available traction on slippery or loose driving surfaces.
Traction-Lock (Limited-slip)
Rear-wheel-drive mechanical system that operates within the differential. Traction-Lock provides added traction on slippery surfaces, particularly when one rear drive wheel has poor traction. Limited-slip is not offered on front-wheel-drive vehicles.
Tractor Brake Control Valve
Mechanism added to a tractor or trailer brake system that safeguards the air supply on the towing unit and automatically applies the brakes on the trailer if it accidentally becomes separated.
Trailer Hitch
There are two types of trailer hitches:
Trailer Sway Control
Works in conjunction with the AdvanceTrac¬Æ or AdvanceTrac¬Æ with RSC¬Æ (Roll Stability Control TM) system to help maintain vehicle/trailer stability while towing a trailer
Measures the yaw motion of a vehicle and applies brake force to individual wheels, and if necessary, reduces engine power to help the driver regain control of the vehicle/trailer
If equipped with the Integrated Trailer Brake Controller, the trailer brakes will also be activated to reduce the sway condition and help the driver regain control of the vehicle/trailer
Trailer Tongue Load
Weight in pounds that a trailer (loaded or unloaded) exerts directly on the hitch ball attached to the towing vehicle. This load is considered in maintaining the loading limits of the vehicle.
Trailing Arm
Suspension element that consists of a longitudinal member that pivots from the body at its forward end and has a wheel hub rigidly attached to its trailing end. Similar to a semi-trailing arm, except that its pivot axis is perpendicular to the car's longitudinal center.
Trailing Link
Suspension link mounted ahead of a wheel and aligned to resist longitudinal motions in the wheel.
Transfer Case
An auxiliary device on a four-wheel-drive vehicle that allows power to be delivered to front and rear differentials.
Transmission/Transaxle
Transaxle
Power-transmission device, attached to one end of the engine, combining the functions of the transmission and the drive axle (final drive and differential) into a single assembly
Typically used on front-wheel-drive applications Transmission
Metal case containing an assembly of shafts, gears and related parts used to transmit power from the engine to the drive shaft or final drive of an automotive vehicle; provides different gear ratios as well as Neutral and Reverse. May be manual, automatic or continuously variable. Typically used on rear-wheel-drive applications Manual Transmission/Transaxle
System in which gears are selected by the driver by means of a hand-operated gearshift lever and afoot-operated clutch
Manual transmissions are typically 5-speed, but high-performance vehicles often use a 6-speed manual Automatic Transmission/Transaxle
Automatic transmissions have hydraulically operated gear sets that require no gear shifting or clutching by the driver
Gears are shifted automatically through the use of hydraulics and electric signals from an on-board computer
A series of gears are applied as the need arises. This need is determined by vehicle weight, load and demand placed upon the performance system
Automatic transmissions come in 4, 5 and 6 speeds. The highest gear is for overdrive Electronically Controlled Continuously Variable Transmission (eCVT)
Used exclusively in the Escape Hybrid
Uses an electronically controlled planetary gear set that includes the traction motor and power management electronics in one compact assembly
Planetary gear set can vary the distribution of power between the gasoline engine and the electric drive system or both, depending on driving conditions
There are no defined gear "steps" as in a conventional transmission
The planetary gear set allows the gasoline engine to operate at its most efficient or powerful engine speed relative to the vehicle's speed. This contributes to efficiency and performance
Transverse-mounted Engine
Power train layout design in which the engine crankshaft centerline is aligned parallel to the drive axle (s)
Engine is mounted sideways in the engine compartment, usually allowing additional interior room
Tuned Intake/Exhaust Systems
Intake and/or exhaust systems that harness the pressure pulses and resonances inside various passages and chambers in the intake and exhaust manifolds to increase the flow of the intake charge into and out of the combustion chambers.
Turbocharger
A supercharger that is driven by a turbine turned by exhaust gases from the engine.
Turning Diameter
Combination of the proper front axle equipment results in an important performance specification. The turning diameter will be of significance to the individual owner as well as the fleet operator. The turning diameter is defined as the diameter of the outside track made by the outside front tire during the shortest turn. The diagram shows the diameter made by the outside edge of the bumper during the shortest turn. Note: When comparing competitive truck specifications, note whether they spec a diameter or radius dimension.
Twin I-Beam Suspension
See Suspension Systems ‚Äî Front.
U

Ultra Low Sulfur Diesel (ULSD) Fuel
Diesel fuel with a maximum sulphur content of 15 parts per million (ppm).
The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has mandated this fuel must be used in new model year 2008diesel engines
This mandate does not apply to carryover engines like the 6.0L Power Stroke¬Æ V8 turbo diesel currently in use in many Ford E-Series trucks
Understeer/Oversteer
Under steer is a condition that occurs when a vehicle turns at a smaller angle than the steering wheel input because of front tire slippage. When this occurs, the steering wheel must be turned at a greater angle to achieve the desired turn. Under steer will be affected by the amount of wheel turn lock-to-lock as well as the vehicle's weight and the speed of the vehicle when encountering turns
Over steer occurs when the vehicle turns more than steering wheel input and is indicated by rear tire slippage. It can make the vehicle hard to control. Because of this, engineers often design suspensions that tend toward under steer as a safety measure
Unitized Body Construction (Unibody)
With unitized body construction, the front, rear and side rails are welded together with the floor pan, cross members and torque boxes to form a single "unit," whereas body-on-frame construction has two pieces, the body and the frame
Commonly used for car and mini van construction in which a solid robust frame is not required
Provides an advantage of less vehicle weight that helps contribute to performance and fuel economy
Unsprung Weight
Components such as tires, wheels and brakes are not supported by the suspension and are considered unsprung weight
Reducing unsprung weight improves ride and handling by allowing the tires to respond more rapidly to road irregularities
Independent rear suspension reduces unsprung weight by attaching the differential to the chassis rather than solidly mounting it with the axle
V
Print
Variable Cam Timing
Variable camshaft timing allows the valves to be operated at different points in the combustion cycle, to provide performance that is precisely tailored to the engine‚Äôs specific speed and load at that instant
The power train control module (PCM) directs solenoids to alter the oil flow in the hydraulic cam timing mechanism, which rotates the camshafts in relation to their drive sprockets
The unit can shift between fully advanced and fully retarded in milliseconds
The result is enhanced efficiency under low-load conditions, such as at idle or highway cruising, and increased power for brisk acceleration or times of high demand
Variable valve timing reduces pumping losses, the work required to pull air in and push exhaust out of the cylinder
Variable-rate Coil Spring
A coil spring operating with a variable number of active coils
Under load, some of the coils will come in contact with one another, thereby becoming inactive‚Äì Process is controlled by the wire diameter of each coil, which is continuously variable for approximately one-third the total number of coils‚Äì Increases the stiffness of the spring in proportion to the load
VIN
Abbreviation for Vehicle Identification Number
Refer to esourcebook.dealerconnection.com for specific information
Viscous Coupling
Fluid coupling in which the input and output shafts mate with thin, alternately spaced discs in a cylindrical chamber filled with a viscous fluid that clings to the discs, thereby causing them to resist the speed differences between the two shafts
Used to limit the speed differences between two inputs on a differential or between two axles on a vehicle

Weight Definitions ‚Äî Actual Weights
Curb Weight
Weight of the vehicle including standard equipment, oil, lubricants and a full tank of fuel. Does not include optional contents or other optional equipment, the weight of driver, passengers or cargo Option Weight
Weight of any added equipment not included in the base curb weight Passenger Weight
Defined as 150 lbs. multiplied by the number of seating positions, including the driver, that the vehicle can carry Payload
Gross payload is defined as the weight of all passengers, options and cargo
Net payload is defined as the weight that can be placed in the truck after subtracting for passenger and optional equipment Gross Vehicle Weight (GVW)
Weight of the vehicle including passengers, options and all cargo Trailer Weight
Weight of a trailer including all attachments, lights, etc. Gross Combination Weight (GCW)
Gross Vehicle Weight plus the trailer weight Gross Axle Weight
Weight loaded on the front or rear axle Tongue Weight
Amount of the trailer‚Äôs weight that presses down on the trailer hitch (usually 10‚Äì15 percent of the trailer‚Äôs weight ,approximately 25 percent for fifth-wheel applications)
Weight Distribution
Portion of a vehicle‚Äôs total weight that will be supported by each axle and each tire. Proper distribution of vehicle weight is critical to braking, handling and to the service life of components such as axles, springs, bearings and tires.
Weight Ratings
Weight ratings are not actual weights, they are ratings that must be adhered to when the vehicle is in use. Payload Rating
Advertised payload rating. It is the maximum allowable payload for the truck Allowable Weight
Maximum amount of weight that can be placed in the vehicle after subtracting allowances for passenger sand options Gross Vehicle Weight Rating (GVWR)
Maximum allowable weight of the loaded vehicle with payload Gross Axle Weight Rating (GAWR)
Maximum allowable weight to be placed on an individual axle. Gross Axle Weight Ratings are provided for both front and rear axles Gross Combination Weight Rating (GCWR)
Maximum allowable weight of the vehicle, its trailer and all associated passengers, cargo and equipment NOTE: Actual weights should never exceed the listed weight ratings. Remind customers that exceeding the recommended weight ratings could disqualify their warranty coverage.
Weight-carrying (Non-weight-distributing) Hitch
Commonly used to tow small- and medium-size trailers
Weight-distributing Receiver Hitch
Used in conjunction with a hitch platform (receiver), distributes tongue weight to all towing vehicle and trailer wheels
Required for certain Class III and all Class IV applications
Weight-distributing hitch platforms are welded or bolted to the vehicle frame. Bolt-on types are recommended because they can be removed
Properly installed bolt-on weight-distributing hitch platform will not weaken the vehicle or underbody as heat from welding might
Equalizing arms are connected from the hitch to the trailer‚Äôs A-frame and are adjusted for best towing performance. Lengths of chain are pulled up and tightened to bend spring bars upward, which lifts some of the weight from the rear wheels and transfers weight to the other wheels of the vehicle and trailer
Wheelbase
Distance between the center points of the front and rear wheels.
Y
Print
Yaw
Vehicle‚Äôs rotation about its vertical axis. Excessive yaw rate is often referred to as fishtailing.
Yield Strength
Maximum amount of stress in pounds per square inch to which a frame may be subjected through loading and return to its original shape upon removal of the stress with no deformation.

Tow. Haul. Do It All.
Medium duty trucks face demands most vehicles never will. The 2026 Ford F-650 and F-750 offer engine and transmission options that give you the power to get the job done.
Class-Exclusive* 7.3L V8 Gas Engine
The 7.3L V8 gas engine features an output of 335 hp and torque of 468 lb.-ft. at 3,750 rpm.** This engine features an overhead valve architecture that generates power low in the rev range to help get heavier loads moving with confidence. It also features a variable-displacement oil pump, extra-large main bearings, forged steel crankshaft for durability and piston cooling jets to help manage temperatures under heavy load.
Aftermarket equipment and extra-cost color option shown.
6.7L Power Stroke¬Æ V8 Turbo Diesel Engine
The 6.7L Power Stroke¬Æ V8 Turbo Diesel engine has a standard power rating of 270 hp/800 lb.-ft. of torque.* You also have your choice of available 300 hp/825 lb.-ft. of torque and 330 hp/850 lb.-ft. of torque power ratings.* The 6.7L was tested to over 500,000 simulated customer miles, which contributes to a B10 design life of more than half a million miles.** The unique inverse-flow design locates the turbocharger between the cylinder heads and the top of the block, with the exhaust manifold inboard and close to the turbo, for faster air displacement and greater power. The standard driver-activated engine exhaust braking restricts exhaust flow to create back pressure for seamless braking and reduced brake wear on downhill grades.‚Ä†
Aftermarket equipment shown.
Ford TorqShift¬Æ Heavy-Duty Automatic Transmissions
Ford TorqShift¬Æ transmissions are specially engineered to handle the heavy demands of the Built Ford Tough¬Æ F-650 and F-750.

The SelectShift¬Æ feature includes Progressive Range Select, which limits the range of gears to lock out overdrive. The Tow/Haul feature selects the gear that minimizes gear hunting on uphills, and prevents upshifting and speed increases on downhills to reduce the need for brake pressure. And TorqShift transmissions offer live-drive Power Take-Off (PTO) capability with stationary and mobile modes, standard with diesel and available with gas.
Extra-cost color option shown.
See Power
Ready for Anything
2026 Ford Medium Duty trucks are engineered for versatility. The available variety of convenient and easy upfits, as well as features like the available live-drive Power Take-Off (PTO) provision (standard on diesel models) with mobile mode*, make F-650 and F-750 models the ultimate work trucks, ready to meet your needs.
Live-Drive Power Take-Off (PTO) Provision with Mobile Mode
The Ford TorqShift¬Æ HD 10-Speed Automatic Transmission, included with diesel engines, has the live-drive Power Take-Off (PTO) provision as standard equipment. An output PTO gear connects directly to the transmission's torque converter impeller hub to allow live-drive to power the PTO any time the engine is running, whether the truck is moving or stopped. Split-shaft capability (diesel only) allows for the installation of a split-shaft gearbox attached to the output shaft of the transmission, which provides torque to two separate PTO outlets when the truck is in stationary mode. The TorqShift HD 6-Speed Automatic Transmission with the available live-drive PTO provision includes stationary and mobile modes for gas engines.*
  Convenient & Easy Upfitting
Ford F-650 and F-750 trucks feature a work-ready frame. Developed with leading upfitters, these frames require few or no modifications to accommodate vocational bodies. This collaboration resulted in the relocation of such components as fuel tanks, battery boxes and diesel exhaust fluid reservoirs under the cab. You can choose from 29 standard clean CA offerings ranging from 84 to 207 inches. Plus, the available Vehicle Integration System 1.0 allows you to develop "smart" logic controls for your final-stage installed equipment‚Äîallowing you to be confident in controlling unique upfit functions.
Aftermarket equipment and extra-cost color option shown.

Available Driver-Assist Technology Package
2026 Ford F-650 and F-750 Medium Duty trucks are equipped with Ford Co-Pilot360¬Æ Technologies10 to help you feel comfortable and in control. Features like Hill Start Assist are standard on hydraulic brake models, while the available Driver-Assist Technology Package includes Pre-Collision Assist with Automatic Emergency Braking, Auto High-Beam Headlamps, Lane-Keeping Alert and more. Ford F-650/F-750 driver-assist technology features are designed to help you be aware and alert you on the road ahead.*

Auto High-Beam Headlamps
We've all been there. Heading into a pitch-black stretch of road and having to turn on the high beams‚Äîthen forgetting to turn them off again as oncoming traffic approaches. Now, unlit roads, dark peripheries and other low-visibility situations don't have to catch you off guard. Auto High-Beam Headlamps can sense poor lighting conditions and switch on to light your path ahead, then dim automatically to keep you from blinding other drivers. So you can keep your focus on the road‚Äîand both hands on the wheel.10

Charging Electric Vehicles at Home
Most drivers of electric vehicles (EVs)‚Äîwhich include all-electric vehicles and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs)‚Äîcharge their vehicles overnight at home using AC Level 1 or AC Level 2 charging equipment. Residential equipment is frequently installed in garages, but outdoor installation and use are also safe, even if the vehicle is being charged in the rain. Outdoor installations require outdoor-rated equipment. Charging at multifamily housing requires additional considerations and may be more like public charging than charging at a single-family home.
Installing Charging Equipment in Your Home
EV owners may install Level 2 (240 V) charging equipment in their homes for a faster charge, or opt for the Level 1 cordset provided with the vehicle as shown here.
Many EV owners are able to meet their daily driving range requirements by charging overnight with Level 1 equipment, requiring no additional cost or installation, provided that a power outlet on a dedicated branch circuit is available near their parking location. Level 2 charging equipment can be installed for drivers with less regular schedules, longer commutes, or EVs with large batteries that require more than overnight (or the typical dwell time) to fully charge. State and utility incentives may be available to help offset the cost of charging equipment.
Most Level 2 products have standard safety features and status lights. More advanced, "smart" Level 2 products have features such as data collection, user interface systems, enhanced displays, charging timers, communications capabilities, and keypads. Purchasing safety-certified equipment is recommended, such as the products certified under the ENERGY STAR label, which are tested by a nationally recognized testing laboratory, along with having a certified electrical contractor.
Electricians can inform homeowners whether their home has adequate electrical capacity for vehicle charging. Some homes might have insufficient electric capacity for Level 2 equipment. However, a qualified electrician can add circuits to accommodate the capacity needed for Level 2 charging.
The city of San Jose, California, was one of the first to issue requirements for installing vehicle charging systems in single-family homes and duplexes, and explains the permitting process and location planning for a home charging unit. In recent years, other cities have followed suit, such as Seattle‚Äôs tip sheets for both residential
and commercial
EV charging installations.
Complying with Regulations
Charging equipment installations must comply with local and state codes and regulations. Appropriate permits may be required from the local building and permitting authorities.
EV charging infrastructure is considered a continuous load by the National Electrical Code (NEC). Your electrical contractor should understand and use the appropriate NEC for a safe and code-compliant installation. NEC Article 625 contains most of the information applicable to charging equipment. If possible, consult vehicle manufacturer guidance for information about the required charging equipment and learn the specifications before purchasing equipment or electrical services.
In many areas, a site installation plan must be submitted to the permitting authority for approval before installation. Consider contacting your local building and permitting authorities for more information on identifying or complying with regulations.
Electricity Costs for Charging
The fuel efficiency of an EV may be measured in kilowatt-hours (kWh) per 100 miles. To calculate the cost per mile of an EV, the cost of electricity (in dollars per kWh) and the efficiency of the vehicle (how much electricity is used to travel 100 miles) must be known. If electricity costs ¬¢10.7 per kWh and the vehicle consumes 27 kWh to travel 100 miles, the cost per mile is about $0.03.
If electricity costs ¬¢10.7 per kilowatt-hour, charging an EV with a 200-mile range (assuming a fully depleted 54 kWh battery) will cost about $6 to reach a full charge. To compare the fueling costs of individual models of conventional and electric vehicles, see the Vehicle Cost Calculator. Note that actual residential electricity costs will depend on the type of equipment installed, as well as the time of day and length of time the charging station is used. Some utilities offer residential time-of-use rates or other rate‚ÄØincentives‚ÄØfor charging infrastructure owners. To learn more about potential cost savings from enrolling in time-of-use rates, see the report: Levelized Cost of Charging Electric Vehicles in the United States.
For EV charging, the stability and planning benefits of household electricity rates offer an attractive alternative compared to traditional types of transportation.

The Spirit of Engineering
Henry Ford himself once raced ten laps on a dirt track against Alexander Winton, then the most famous racing driver in the world. The technologically advanced ‚Äú1901 Sweepstakes‚Äù car he and his associates designed for the race helped him secure an upset victory over his rival ‚Äî and financial backing from investors. 18 months later, he started Ford Motor Company.

Henry‚Äôs first race was also his last (‚ÄúOnce is enough,‚Äù he quipped at the time), but his legacy of ingenuity lives on. The demands of motorsport have made courses and tracks across the world ideal test beds for innovations in everything from handling to safety. And while every Ford model benefits, our performance vehicles prove we‚Äôre still searching for the limits of our craft.

Official N√ºrburgring Time
One Car, One Mission: Make N√ºrburgring History
Come along for the ride ‚Äî from test day to track day ‚Äî with the ‚ÄúRoad to the Ring‚Äù documentary. Get an exclusive, behind-the-scenes look at the Mustang GTD, born from the hands of Ford Performance engineers and designers. See how they took on the 73 corners of Germany's famed 12.9-mile long N√ºrburgring. And joined the elite group of supercars with a sub 7-minute lap time.


Vehicle Details
Street Legal. But Just Barely.
Game-changing tech. Street-legal, track-ready supercar capability. And most importantly, Mustang soul. The first-ever Mustang¬Æ GTD combines it all, to create a race car for the road.
The Journey Begins
Low-Profile Performance
Elemental Performance
Pursuit of Perfection
Driven by Function
Performance Art
It‚Äôs unlike any Mustang you‚Äôve ever experienced. Boldly engineered. Brilliantly advanced. Brutally powerful. Capable of competing with Europe‚Äôs best on any track ‚Äî but made to deliver its projected 800-plus horsepower* directly to the American road. See what set Mustang¬Æ GTD apart from the pack in its pursuit of clearing the famed N√ºrburgring in less than 7 minutes.

Monstrous Potency on Pavement
Inspired by the track-only Mustang¬Æ GT3 race car, Mustang GTD is purposefully designed to be the quickest roadgoing Mustang ever.
Slide 1 of 2
Supercharged 5.2L V8
The Ford Performance-engineered 5.2L V8 engine with 8-speed dual-clutch transmission is tuned to target more than 800 horsepower* ‚Äî that's ready to conquer the streets and the track.
Near 50/50 Weight Balance
All the Mustang¬Æ GTD power is transmitted through a lightweight carbon fiber driveshaft connected to an 8-speed rear transaxle, for near 50/50 weight distribution. This results in extremely responsive handling and performance ‚Äî with a target of clearing the N√ºrburgring's 73 turns and corners in less than 7 minutes.
Semi-Active Suspension
Experience a state-of-the-art, pavement-grabbing ride. Featuring a unique short-long arm front suspension that provides enhanced lateral stiffness and improved kinematics, especially in high-G cornering. Combined with a first-of-its-kind dual ride height, it's optimized to smooth out dynamic conditions on surface streets and road courses alike.
A Mustang Rumble the Whole World Will Hear
Formed carbon fiber body panels, an aerodynamic rear wing for road-gripping downforce, and a driver-centric interior with an immersive digital cockpit make a powerful statement.
Cooling Multi-Purpose Front Fender Vents
Beyond adding eye-catching style, the standard front fender vents help keep the brakes cool. At the same time, they reduce lift and drag by releasing built-up air pressure from inside the wheel arches.
Forged Carbon Ceramic Brakes
Stop with authority around town ‚Äî and at the track ‚Äî with standard front six-piston Brembo‚Ñ¢ anti-lock brakes. They‚Äôre combined with enormous 325 mm front and 345 mm rear Michelin¬Æ Pilot Sport Cup 2 tires for race-ready capability and standout looks.
Brembo is a trademark of Brembo S.p.A.
At These Speeds, Even Gravity Needs Help
The standard carbon fiber, C-pillar-mounted aero rear wing provides massive downforce to produce responsive control while driving corner speeds up. Active aerodynamics are also available.
Titanium Isn‚Äôt Just for Fighter Jets
A lightweight titanium Akrapoviƒç¬Æ exhaust adds dynamic style to the rear and helps define the soul-stirring growl of the supercharged 5.2L Predator V8 engine. Leaving no doubt who‚Äôs leading the pack ‚Äî even when you fly by in a blur.
Like Cutting-Edge Gaming. With Real G-Forces.
Mustang¬Æ GTD models feature electrical architecture from the latest Mustang lineup. Access seamless connectivity, personalized driving modes, Track Apps¬Æ* and more.
Modifiable Racing Suspension Tech
The available semi-active suspension and hydraulic control system features Track Mode. It allows you to drive the Mustang¬Æ GTD coupe to the racecourse and then lower it nearly 40mm to competition height. Further increasing aerodynamics and performance.
Driver-Centric Digital Cockpit
Every drive is turned into a visually stunning experience with the 12.4" LCD digital cluster and expansive 13.2" center touchscreen. This immersive dual display can be customized as you see fit. Featuring videogame-inspired graphics powered by the Unreal¬Æ gaming engine, attention-grabbing colors and more ‚Äî giving you total, personalized control of your cockpit screens.
Commanding Connectivity
Displayed on the massive 13.2" center touchscreen, SYNC¬Æ 427  lets you connect your compatible smartphone for a personalized driving experience. Featuring natural voice recognition, one-step destination search, music streaming and wireless phone connection for your favorite apps ‚Äî to keep you connected, entertained and in the moment.
Bring Mustang¬Æ GTD style to your home screen.
Choose from a selection of exclusive, downloadable wallpapers for your phone, tablet, or computer.

Official N√ºrburgring Time
One Car, One Mission: Make N√ºrburgring History
Come along for the ride ‚Äî from test day to track day ‚Äî with the ‚ÄúRoad to the Ring‚Äù documentary. Get an exclusive, behind-the-scenes look at the Mustang GTD, born from the hands of Ford Performance engineers and designers. See how they took on the 73 corners of Germany's famed 12.9-mile long N√ºrburgring. And joined the elite group of supercars with a sub 7-minute lap time.


Vehicle Details
Street Legal. But Just Barely.
Game-changing tech. Street-legal, track-ready supercar capability. And most importantly, Mustang soul. The first-ever Mustang¬Æ GTD combines it all, to create a race car for the road.
The Journey Begins
Low-Profile Performance
Elemental Performance
Pursuit of Perfection
Driven by Function
Performance Art
It‚Äôs unlike any Mustang you‚Äôve ever experienced. Boldly engineered. Brilliantly advanced. Brutally powerful. Capable of competing with Europe‚Äôs best on any track ‚Äî but made to deliver its projected 800-plus horsepower* directly to the American road. See what set Mustang¬Æ GTD apart from the pack in its pursuit of clearing the famed N√ºrburgring in less than 7 minutes.

Monstrous Potency on Pavement
Inspired by the track-only Mustang¬Æ GT3 race car, Mustang GTD is purposefully designed to be the quickest roadgoing Mustang ever.
Slide 1 of 2
Supercharged 5.2L V8
The Ford Performance-engineered 5.2L V8 engine with 8-speed dual-clutch transmission is tuned to target more than 800 horsepower* ‚Äî that's ready to conquer the streets and the track.
Near 50/50 Weight Balance
All the Mustang¬Æ GTD power is transmitted through a lightweight carbon fiber driveshaft connected to an 8-speed rear transaxle, for near 50/50 weight distribution. This results in extremely responsive handling and performance ‚Äî with a target of clearing the N√ºrburgring's 73 turns and corners in less than 7 minutes.
Semi-Active Suspension
Experience a state-of-the-art, pavement-grabbing ride. Featuring a unique short-long arm front suspension that provides enhanced lateral stiffness and improved kinematics, especially in high-G cornering. Combined with a first-of-its-kind dual ride height, it's optimized to smooth out dynamic conditions on surface streets and road courses alike.
A Mustang Rumble the Whole World Will Hear
Formed carbon fiber body panels, an aerodynamic rear wing for road-gripping downforce, and a driver-centric interior with an immersive digital cockpit make a powerful statement.
Cooling Multi-Purpose Front Fender Vents
Beyond adding eye-catching style, the standard front fender vents help keep the brakes cool. At the same time, they reduce lift and drag by releasing built-up air pressure from inside the wheel arches.
Forged Carbon Ceramic Brakes
Stop with authority around town ‚Äî and at the track ‚Äî with standard front six-piston Brembo‚Ñ¢ anti-lock brakes. They‚Äôre combined with enormous 325 mm front and 345 mm rear Michelin¬Æ Pilot Sport Cup 2 tires for race-ready capability and standout looks.
Brembo is a trademark of Brembo S.p.A.
At These Speeds, Even Gravity Needs Help
The standard carbon fiber, C-pillar-mounted aero rear wing provides massive downforce to produce responsive control while driving corner speeds up. Active aerodynamics are also available.
Titanium Isn‚Äôt Just for Fighter Jets
A lightweight titanium Akrapoviƒç¬Æ exhaust adds dynamic style to the rear and helps define the soul-stirring growl of the supercharged 5.2L Predator V8 engine. Leaving no doubt who‚Äôs leading the pack ‚Äî even when you fly by in a blur.
Like Cutting-Edge Gaming. With Real G-Forces.
Mustang¬Æ GTD models feature electrical architecture from the latest Mustang lineup. Access seamless connectivity, personalized driving modes, Track Apps¬Æ* and more.
Modifiable Racing Suspension Tech
The available semi-active suspension and hydraulic control system features Track Mode. It allows you to drive the Mustang¬Æ GTD coupe to the racecourse and then lower it nearly 40mm to competition height. Further increasing aerodynamics and performance.
Driver-Centric Digital Cockpit
Every drive is turned into a visually stunning experience with the 12.4" LCD digital cluster and expansive 13.2" center touchscreen. This immersive dual display can be customized as you see fit. Featuring videogame-inspired graphics powered by the Unreal¬Æ gaming engine, attention-grabbing colors and more ‚Äî giving you total, personalized control of your cockpit screens.
Commanding Connectivity
Displayed on the massive 13.2" center touchscreen, SYNC¬Æ 427  lets you connect your compatible smartphone for a personalized driving experience. Featuring natural voice recognition, one-step destination search, music streaming and wireless phone connection for your favorite apps ‚Äî to keep you connected, entertained and in the moment.

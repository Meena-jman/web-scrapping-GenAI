Innovative power plant solutions
Individual power plants that create value
As energy consumption will continue to increase in the years to come, efficient power generation will be a vital component to reliable, eco-friendly energy systems. Fluctuations are more frequently and at shorter intervals. Energy markets around the world are demanding more and more from their participants – whether that be responding flexibly to fluctuations, observing increasingly stringent emission limits, supplying power at lower and lower costs, or ensuring supply under adverse conditions. Anyone looking to stay ahead of the game needs more than an “off-the-shelf” power plant.   You need an individual power plant solution aligned with your objectives? Whether it’s a small, integrated system or a heavy-duty power plant, a purely gas-fired simple cycle or a hydrogen or a combined cycle power plant, we’ll collaborate closely with you to find and construct a solution optimized specifically for you.

Flexible AC transmission systems (FACTS)
Grid stability and power quality made to measure. The growing number of decentralized renewables is making it much more difficult to ensure reliable and stable grid operation. Flexible AC transmission systems (FACTS) are the perfect solution for increasing the reliability of AC grids, ensuring stability, and boosting transmission efficiency. With these modular and customized flexible AC transmission systems solutions from a single source, high voltage fluctuations and power failures can be prevented, network assets can be optimally utilized, and load-induced disturbances can be mitigated. Siemens Energy supports customers around the world with innovative FACTS to help them master the challenges of energy transitions.

Driving a resilient future: key energy transition strategies
Five energy transition strategies we’re taking to transform the energy system.
The energy transition promises to herald in a future where electricity becomes the core of our energy systems and huge leaps in clean energy innovation further drive down the prices of renewable energy and create a rapid shift away from coal and oil toward an economy powered by carbon-neutral, hydrogen-based fuels. Yet today, energy is still responsible for more than 70 percent of emissions, and the climate crisis is already affecting every region of the planet, leaving aging energy systems vulnerable to strain and disruption. More than ever, the world needs a new energy era, one resilient enough to recover quickly from shocks and support the global economy.

Rethinking powering data centers
Data centers face significant challenges as power demand soars, with projections indicating they will consume as much electricity as Japan within a year and 4% of global generation by 2030. This rapid growth strains grid systems, which struggle to keep pace, while data centers compete with other industries for limited electricity supplies amid environmental compliance pressures. How can we effectively address the energy dilemma facing data centers?

Green hydrogen production
Electrolyzer for green hydrogen production in detail
Decarbonizing through green hydrogen
Green hydrogen (H2) is a versatile energy carrier that can be applied to decarbonize a wide range of sectors. It can be used directly or in the form of its derivatives like e-Methanol, e-Ammonia, or e-Fuels to replace fossil fuels like coal or gas.
Only around emissions originate from power generation which . The other 60% of CO emissions originate from industry, mobility, buildings and others. These can be , using green hydrogen and its derivatives to make renewable energy available to those sectors. This is why the production of sustainable hydrogen is so important for the energy transition.

Pioneering technology
RecyclableBlade
Siemens Gamesa is leading the way for a sustainable future with the RecyclableBlade, the first product to offer a comprehensive recyclable solution that is ready for commercial use both offshore and onshore.
The wind industry is still relatively young and is aware of the responsibility it holds of finding a sustainable way to deal with wind turbine components at the end of their life cycle. Increasing the recyclability of the wind components is high on our agenda, and we are committed to producing 100% recyclable turbines by 2040.

Taking innovation offshore: the Kaskasi wind energy project, a world first. And why policymakers should care
Sustainability
We are 35 kilometers off the coast of the German island of Heligoland in the North Sea. For the last few years, Daniel and his crew of engineers and technicians have been working on a world first for the industry. They installed the first commercial recyclable wind turbine blades here, and in July 2022 these turbines generated their first green energy output. The Kaskasi wind project, along with two other offshore sites Amrumbank West and Nordsee Ost, forms part of RWE’s Heligoland Cluster.

The FOD4Wind project estimates a reduction of 13,000 tons of CO2 in 2030
Offshore
We must innovate in the use of drones to service offshore wind farms cheaper, faster and more efficiently. The research project FOD4Wind between Energy Cluster Denmark, ESVAGT, Upteko, University of Southern Denmark (SDU) and Siemens Gamesa can reduce downtime and eliminate fixed costs for servicing offshore wind. Based on estimations of the project team, with 70 installed charging stations with drones, the annual effect in 2030 will be reduced downtime of 12,250 hours, 13,000 tons of CO2 reduction, increased energy production by 39,200 MWh, reduced costs for service by 57 million Euros and additional employment of 180 employees.

Driving the energy transition
Discover strategies, solutions, and technologies to move the energy transition forward
The energy transition is one of the most pressing global challenges of our time. It requires the shift towards more sustainable low carbon alternatives to limit earth’s warming to below 2º C. However, at 37.7 billion metric tons, global energy related CO2 emissions reached a new record in 2023. Current policies predict global CO2 emissions will peak soon, but without a significant decline, we’re on track for a 2.4º C temperature rise by the end of the century.

Offshore grid connection solutions for efficient and reliable power transmission at sea
Connections to a secure, reliable, and more decarbonized world of energy
Integrating renewable energy sources and decarbonizing existing electricity infrastructure are key to meeting society’s energy needs while fighting climate change. Yet, these contributions to more carbon-neutral energy take place in remote areas often hundreds or even thousands of kilometers away from the centers of consumption. Effective solutions are vital to connecting all distributed power generation sources to the grid to make electricity available where it is really needed.

Renewable energy: Harness the power of the future
Utilize the potential of the sun, wind, water and more
Renewable sources including solar, wind, hydropower and biofuels are vital in the transition towards less carbon-intensive energy systems. And while the generation of electricity from the sun and wind has grown rapidly in recent years, further expansion is urgently needed to keep the 1.5°C climate target within reach. According to the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), an average of 1,000GW of renewable energy capacity needs to be added every year until 2030.

Bringing Zero closer: Gas-insulated switchgear and busduct
With Zero F-gases and Zero harm, our Blue switchgear solutions make a greener grid achievable.
Why we need to go for Zero. And why you need Blue.
With the energy sector having a greater carbon impact than every other industry combined, the urgent need for decarbonization to combat climate change cannot be overstated. Renewable energy sources are only part of the solution; at Siemens Energy we understand how essential it is to achieve Zero Global Warming Potential (GWP) in the transmission of power as well as in its generation.

Even the new F-gas alternatives are still harmful to the environment when released. That’s not sustainable, as recognized by the new EU-F-gas-regulation. And it’s why we’ve developed our Zero-harm Blue portfolio, including gas-insulated switchgear and gas-insulated busduct.
